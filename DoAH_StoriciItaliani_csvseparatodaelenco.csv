School of Specialization in History of Medieval and Modern Art, University of Rome"",National Museum of Palermo","Art Historian and scholar of Sicilian art and decorative arts, Director, Museo Nazionale di Messina (1949-1966). Maria Accascina was born in Naples in 1898 to a family originally from Palermo. Accascina moved to her family’s city, Palermo, to study Literature. After graduation she went to the Regia Scuola di Perfezionamento in Storia dell’Arte Medievale e Moderna dell’Università di Roma. At this time, she studied under Adolfo Venturi who assisted her with her thesis on medieval goldsmithing. This thesis led Accascina to her well-known research of decorative Sicilian art from the medieval to modern to contemporary periods. During this time she began teaching History of Art at the Umberto high school in Palermo. In 1927 she was hired by the Royal Administration of Fine Arts where she was in charge of Regia Commissariato per la tutela degli oggetti d’arte della Sicilia. In 1928 she was commissioned to take charge of the Medieval and Modern section of the National Museum of Palermo. Her charge over the National Museum of Palermo inspired new publications of museology including:”L'organizzazione dell'oreficeria al Museo Nazionale di Palermo” and “Il riordino della Galleria del Museo Nazionale di Palermo.” both published in Bolletino d’Arte, of which she was an author under the Ministry of Public Education, between 1929 and 1930.

After her work at the  Museo Nazionale di Palermo (National Museum of Palermo), she went on to teach at the Universities of Rome, Cagliari and Messina. During the years of Italian fascism, 1934 and 1941, she was an art critic for the “Giornale di Sicilia.” Her art writing has been said to stand out due to her poetic intonations and her commitment to the protection of art history. Accascina wrote to Mussolini during World War, arguing for the protection of goldsmith work, to which she dedicated much of her life work. Her articles in the Giornale di Sicilia focused on the works of various exhibitions. She later wrote in Giglio di Roccia in 1937 and Bulletin of Art in 1938. She also wrote entries for the Enciclopedia Cattolica  and La Enciclopedia Italiana (“Treccani”).

  

In 1937 she was inaugurated to the Exhibition of Sacred Art in the Madonie, which drew attention to the art of unknown Sicilian masters. Her articles in later years focused on Sicilian art, including her 1938 article on Sicilian textile and 1938 article “Italianità dell'arte siciliana.” Accascina was an advocate for the educational function of art and the importance of defending and protecting Sicilian artistic heritage. 

In 1949, she moved to Messina to manage the National Museum of Messina. She stayed here until 1966. Her mission was to redesign the National Museum, which was damaged by the bombings of the Second World War. The Minister of Public Education Gaetano Martino (1900-1967) inaugurated the refurbished Museum on June 7, 1954. She remained dedicated to the museum and its educational purpose. According to Sofia Cuccia, who organized the scholar’s works, stated that Accascina was committed to the enhancement of historical and artistic heritage (Critical History). After World War II, she took an active role in the Sicilian Committee for the recovery of funds for the restoration of works damaged by the war.

Accascina participated in a collaboration in the Mostra di opere d'arte bizantine at the Royal Palace of Palermo. A year later, she participated in Congrès international d’histore du costume held at Palazzo Grassi in Venice. In 1953 she organized an art exhibition in Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome called Nella vita del Sud Italia. In 1958 she created an exhibition of unpublished works of art in Messina. Her lecture on Three Unpublished by Rinaldo Bonanno became published by the Proceedings of the Peloritana Academy of Messina in 1965.

In 1969, she delivered lectures on Sicilian artistic civilization in the United States, specifically at Rockefeller Foundation in New York, at Yale University, and at Harvard University. Her studies of Sicilian silverware led to The Sicilian Goldsmith’s from the 12th to the 19th century which was published in 1974 and remains important. In 1976, she published Trademarks of the gold and silverware of Sicily for Sicula Bank of Trapani. One of the projects she was never able to complete was writing the complete history of art in Sicily, whose various volumes would cover the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Baroque, and all the way to the Contemporary age. She died in 1979 in Palermo. The Center  of Decorative Arts in Italy OADI) is named after Accascina and a street in Palermo, the Via Maria Accascina.

Alfieri was born to a noble and wealthy family. His father was Count Antonio Alfieri and his mother Monica Maillard de Tournonthe marquis di Cacherano of Savoy. Count Alfieri died when Vittorio was less than one year old. His mother married a third husband, the cavalier Giacinto Alfieri de Magliano. Vittorio was privately tutored under Don Ivaldi, a priest whose education was poor enough to move him in 1758 to the Military Academy of Turin. Alfieri heard his first opera in 1762 in Turin and thereafter became a devotee. He studied civil and canon law in 1762, achieving a law degree in Turin in 1766. In 1776 he became an ensign in the provincial regiment of Asti. His first language was French, in which he kept a diary. Alfieri left the military academy, taking a grand tour of France, England, and Holland for three years (1766-1768). Accompanied by an English tutor, he traveled to Milan, paying a visit to the Ambrosian Library, to Florence and its art galleries and churches, which left him cold, although Michelangelo's tomb in Santa Croce he found compelling. Alfieri proceeded to France and the French theater. He was formally received at Versailles where Louis XV simply stared at him, and Prussia of Frederick the Great, ""the infamous trade of soldier, the most infamous and sole basis of all arbitrary authority."" In 1771 in Paris, he declined to meet Jean Jacques Rousseau, but purchased a thirty-six volume collection of Italian authors, many of whose names he had never heard. He had never seriously read Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, Boccaccio, or Machiavelli. Alfieri's few friends included Francesco Gori Gandellini, a wealthy and erudite merchant interested in literature and history. While traveling in England, Alfieri fell in love with Penelope Pitt, wife of Lord Ligonier. The love affair ended in a duel with the lady's husband and the divorce of the Lady. Alfieri's first play, Cleopatra, was staged in Turin in 1775. Cleopatra was acclaimed for its vigorous and original style, and when its popularity soared. In 1777, he fell in love with Louise Stolberg, countess of Albany, wife of the pretender Charles Edward Stuart, the last of the English Stuarts. In 1784 she obtained a legal separation. Alfieri and countess remained together for the rest of Alfieri's life. Four of his tragedies were printed in Siena in 1782, and six more toward the end of the same year. In 1787, Alfieri returned to France to supervise the printing of the complete edition of his tragedies, now numbering nineteen, by the publisher Didot. Although at first a supporter of the Revolution he quickly changed when observing the mob violence. Alfieri spent the last ten years of his life in Florence. The city was occupied in 1796 by French troops. He directed and acted in a few plays. Alfieri is buried in the church of Santa Croce in Florence in a tomb designed by Antonio Canova, near Michelangelo and Machiavelli.","","Kultermann, Udo. The History of Art History.

"Arcangeli, Francesco","Arcangeli, Francesco","","10 July 1915","1974","Bologna, Italy","","Italy","male","","","Modernist. Art historian of Bolognese and Emilian art from the fourteenth century to the contemporary; critic. Arcangeli was born to Adolfo and Maria Villani. He was one of four siblings, all of whom were creative. Gaetano was a poet and humanities professor, Nino was a musician, and Bianca was a painter.

Arcangeli began his studies at the University of Bologna in 1933 where he studied under the respected art historian and critic Roberto Longhi, Professor of Art History and chair in History of Medieval and Modern Art. Before taking his degree with Longhi, Arcangeli abandoned his first History degree thesis project on the Italian historian Francesco Guicciardini (1483-1540) who was a contemporary of Machiavelli. In 1937, Arcangeli defended his thesis entitled “Iacopo di Paolo in the Development of Bolognese painting (the frescoes of the Pomposa Chapter-House). His thesis argued for a correction regarding the attribution of the Pomposa frescoes by Italian art historian Mario Salmi (1889-1980). Arcangeli identified Iacopo di Paolo as the painter of the frescoes on the basis that the painter had direct knowledge of Giotto’s Paduan frescoes. Arcangeli’s thesis introduced the idea that the frescoes were painted one hundred years after than the conventional dating of the early fourteenth century. In addition, Arcangeli’s argument for di Paolo challenged the work of Mario Salmi (1889-1980) who had written about Giotto’s influence only in di Paolo’s Ravenna works.

In 1941, a year after Italy entered the war, Arcangeli began teaching History of Art at the Liceo Minghetti in Bologna as well as assisting Longhi at the university. He taught for many years at various high schools. During the war, he served as Inspector of the Bologna, Ferrara, Folì and Ravenna Art Galleries Office. In this role, he daily saved artistic heritage from the risks of war.

 Arcangeli’s methodology differed from that of his lifelong mentor. While Longhi’s methodology focussed on formalism and connoisseurship, Arcangeli felt that “(formal interpretation must be contextual…”. In the analysis of Claudio Spadoni, editor of the 2006 tribute to the art historian, Arcangeli looked for an existential interpretation of a work of art that would lead to examinations of consciousness. He was familiar with the French existentialists of the time, and influenced by the work of Albert Camus.

As an art critic, Arcangeli published his reviews and articles in various Italian language and English language journals and magazines for over thirty years, such as L’Approdo, L’Europeo, Artnews, and The Burlington Magazine among many others. His first piece on Venice appeared in L’Assalto in 1931 when Arcangeli was sixteen. In 1948, “L’Impressionismo a Venezia,” his review on the French works at that year’s Biennale, was published in La Rassegna d’Italia and won the exhibition’s first prize for criticism.

His writings on art, literature, and poetry consistently appeared in the bimonthly magazine Paragone founded by Longhi and Anna Banti in 1950. One of his most well-known articles “Gli ultimi naturalisti” (The Last Naturalists) was published in Paragone in 1954; in it, Arcangeli focussed on the current work of painters such as Ennio Morlotti (1910-1992) and Sergio Vacchi (1925-2016) among others, and celebrated the works’ expressiveness and depictions of nature, which Arcangeli described as “…overflowing, disturbing, yet still loving…”. in the paintings which he calls naturalistic. In 1972 Paragone published Arcangeli’s “Lo spazio romantico” (The Romantic Space) which contained the art historian’s definitive perspective that English Romanticism of the eighteenth-century should be seen as the precursor to modernism. With this understanding, Arcangeli evaluated the art since l’art informel.

In the spring of 1942, Arcàngeli joined the editorial staff of Architrave led by editor Pio Marsili. Arcàngeli wrote a column on the arts for the monthly paper of the fascist Bolognese university students. According to Arcàngeli, this editorial staff, the third in the life of the publication, was “modestly but decisively antifascist.” Arcàngeli also participated in the anti-fascist group “Fronda.” By the winter of 1942, the editorial team had been denounced to the local Commissione per il confino di polizia, the paper was shut down, and Arcàngeli along with his colleagues were sentenced to three years of exile. Arcangeli and his colleagues spent a week in the San Giovanni in Monte prison until Longhi and painter Mino Maccari (1898-1989) intervened with the Ministry for their release. Arcangeli’s interest in anarchism continue to inform his work, but in a less forthright way after the events of 1942. In a 1973 interview he would say: “My first statement on anarchy was made in writing in 1956, so of course it’s something I've thought about for a long time. Before saying “I’m an anarchist” one should think it out carefully. Because it’s such an elevated concept that makes one tremble.”

In 1958 Arcangeli was appointed Director of the Civic Center in Bologna, and oversaw the creation of reborn Gallery of Modern Art in 1961.

1961 was also the year his book on Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was published, receiving critical acclaim. Arcangeli had spent more than a decade writing the monograph of his close friend who had approached the art historian as early as 1952 about taking on the task.

Arcàngeli succeeded Longhi in 1967 as Professor of Art History at the University of Bologna. His lectures in the classroom would lead to a 1970 exhibition “Natura ed espressione nell'arte bolognese-emiliana” (Nature and Expression in Bolognese-Emilian Art). Included in the exhibition were works by Wiligelmus (Italian sculptor active c. 1099 to 1120), Vitale da Bologna (1310-1360), Amico Aspertini (1474-1552), Ludovico Carracci (1555-1619), Giuseppe Crespi (1665-1747) and Morandi which together presented the pertinent themes regarding space, details, human life and porto-impressionism among other points that connected art throughout the centuries that Arcangeli had spent his career articulating. In addition, his lectures were the material for his two volume publication Dal romanticismo all’informale (1977) that contained his thoughts and writing on Italian, European, and American artists over the previous twenty-five years.

In the two years leading up to his unexpected death in 1974, Arcangeli organized the 1972 Venice Biennale according to the theme of “Opera o comportamento” (Work or Behavior); his monograph on the English artist Graham Sutherland (1903-1980) was published in 1973.

Aretino's father was a shoemaker, known as Luca del Tura. Aretino himself trained both as a writer and an artist. After time in Venice and Siena, Aretino was in Rome by 1517 where he was attached to the household of Agostino Chigi (1466-1520). There he met Sebastiano del Piombo and Jacopo Sansovino, Raphael, and Michelangelo. He was briefly in the circle of Pope Leo X (1475-1521). Aretino was frequently associated with political tracts, satires and illustrated erotica. In 1525 he was forced to flee Rome because of the publication of the erotic I Modi texts (illustrations by Marcantonio Raimondi after Giulio Romano) and by 1527 he had settled permanently in Venice. There he associated with Venetian artists, including Titian. Beginning in 1538 he published The Letters (Lettere), a biography of his experiences in letter form. Many of the letters pertained to art and artists. Important entries include the 1537 and 1545 entries on Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, and others to Titian. Concluding posthumously in 1557, the Lettere form a valuable commentary on the life and works of renaissance artists. Like other art critics of the period, he employed a personal and somewhat subjective genre of art analysis. Giorgio Vasari used them as a model, in part, for his more important Lives of the Artists (1550). The Lettere employed both analytical criticism, such as that of the Michelangelo painting, and ekphrastic descriptions, such as that praising Vasari's cartoon of the Fall of Manna. Aretino possessed an small art collection, portions of which are extant in modern collections. Portraits of him exist by Raimondi, Sebastiano del Piombo and Titian, the latter located in the Frick Collection, New York) and a similar likeness by Titian, the Ecce homo, 1543 in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. His religious writing and artistic description influenced contemporary artists.","[first appearance of the Lettere] I qvattro libri de la hvmanità di Christo.

Argan's father, Valerio Argan, was an administrator of a women's mental hospital and his mother, Libera Roncaroli, a primary school teacher. An uncle's subscription to the journal La Critica, founded by Benedetto Croce, introduced the ideas of that art philosopher to Argan at a young age. He attended the Liceo Classico Cavour in Turin where the classes of the young Giusta Nicco Fasola (1901-1960) instilled a passion for art. He painted skillfully enough to win local art competitions. Argan entered the University of Turin in 1927 to study law. The lectures of Lionello Venturi on Impressionism convinced him to give up painting as a pastime for art history, particularly architectural history. An initial article, on Palladio's architecture, appeared in Venturi's journal L'arte in 1930. Argan received a Laurea degree in art history at Turin, writing his dissertation under Venturi in 1930 on Sebastiano Serlio's treatise on architecture. In 1931 he secured a fellowship to work as an Assistant at the University of Rome's school of art history under Pietro Toesca. In 1933 he began his career in various capacities of the fine arts administration, principally in Rome. These included director of the Pinacoteca Estense in Modena and Inspector of Museums and Art Galleries, 1933-1935, and then Minister of Fine Arts. From 1936, he was associated with the group of intellectual who wrote for Casabella, marrying its editor, Anna Maria Mazzucchelli, in 1939. Working closely with Bottai, the minister of Culture, he endowed a government institute for restoration, seating his friend, Cesare Brandi as first director in 1938. During World War II, Argan applied his Crocean anti-fascist beliefs to work against the German usurping Italian cultural property during the occupation. Following the war he worked on a committee with Roberto Longhi to restore stolen Italian artworks. Argan's reading took on a decidedly Marxist direction, studying the works of Gramshi, Husserl, Adorno and Marcuse, which had been unknown in Italy during fascism. As Inspector for the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage he quarreled with (and likely fired) Federico Zeri in 1952 accusing Zeri of a conflict of interest with Zeri's private consultation. Argan taught at the University of Palermo 1954-58 and then succeeded his mentor, Venturi as chair of modern art at the University of Rome in 1959. During this time, he authored his three-volume Storia dell'arte italiana, in 1968, and the volume on modern European art for the prestigious German-language art history, Propyläen Kunstgeschichte in 1977. In 1976 he relinquished his professorship when he was elected Mayor of Rome (through 1979) as a Communist and later, in the same party, as a senator, 1981-1992. In 1987 he co-founded the magazine Storia dell'Arte, co-edited with Luigi Salerno. Methodologically, Argan wove a wide variety of techniques into his writing, including structuralism. His Storia dell'arte italiana remains his most influential work. A glimpse of his writing in English can be gleaned in his 1967 essay on Renaissance Art in the volume 20,000 years of World Painting.","[dissertation:] Trattato d'architecture d' Sebastiano Serlio.

"Baglione, Giovanni","Baglione, Giovanni  ","""il sordo del barozzo""","1566","1643","Rome, Italy","Rome, Italy","Italy","male","","","Painter and first historian of the Roman Baroque through two early art histories, a biography of artists, Vite de' pittori, scultori, architetti (1642), and a survey of Roman churches, Le nove chiese di Roma (1639). Baglione described himself as having descended a noble family from Perugia. In his autobiography appended to his Lives of the Artists, Le vite, 1642, Baglione claimed as well that he studied art under the painter Francesco Morelli in Rome. He worked as a painter, employing a Caravaggesque style, and received numerous commissions. By 1600 Baglione was an Accademia di S Luca member. He brought a libel suit against Caravaggio in 1603 for some verses supposedly written by him against Baglione. Within that context Orazio Gentileschi, a plaintiff in the suit, admitted Baglione a ""first-class painter."" Baglione was knighted in 1606. Between 1621 and 1622 he traveled to Mantua. In the 1630s, he began compiling notes for his two art-historical works. Baglione published his first, Le nove chiese di Roma, a discussion on the contemporary paintings and sculpture in nine major Roman churches, with some references to ancient and medieval works, in 1639. This alone might have secured him the sobriquet ""First historian of the Roman Baroque"" (Pace), because Le nove chiese is more than a devotional guidebook for pilgrims, the genre of the period. His more important work, Le vite de' pittori, scultori & architetti, a biography of artists, appeared in 1642 in Rome, containing biographies of more than 200 artists who worked in Rome between 1572 and 1642. A second edition with an expanded section on the achievements of Pope Urban VIII was issued, also in Rome, in 1649. Subsequent editions were issued from Naples in 1733, 1739 and 1743. Le nove chiese di Roma was, in the words of Roberto Longhi, the ""first strictly artistic guide of the churches of Rome."" It's importance today is the snapshot it gives of Roman churches which were all significantly altered. Baglione's ""guide"" avoids religious discussion and hagiography and focuses on the art and artists of the churches. Le vite de' pittori, scultori & architetti became an important primary source for 17th-century art in Rome. A broad-minded critic who avoided overly theoretical discussions of many art biographies--unlike other biographers of the period--he used his knowledge as a practicing artist to evaluate, often singularly, the important stylistic transformations occurring at the time of his writing. He limited the discussion of paintings to those viewable by the public (with few exceptions) for readers to better appreciate his own criticism. He praised Caravaggio, despite his legal disputes. His commentary included architecture and sculpture. Baglione's anecdotes on artist's lives--a necessary feature on biographies, then as now--also provide insights on the realities of commissions and the conditions for artistic success in the 17th century. In his own time Giovanni Pietro Bellori used Baglione's Vite for his book Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti moderni of 1672, though Bellori was jealous of Baglione's authority accused him of having the work ghostwritten by the antiquarian Ottavio Tronsarelli (d. 1646). Others using Baglione included Carlo Cesare Malvasia for his biographies published beginning in 1678, Giovanni Battista Passeri for his work of 1678 and in Spain, Acisclo Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco in his Museo pictórico y escala óptica, 1715-1724. His work became an important source for modern art historians studying his age, including Luigi Antonio Lanzi, Girolamo Cluento Nettunio Baruffaldi, Hermann Voss, Jacob Hess and Anthony Blunt. The importance of his work is testified by the fact that a separate index to it appeared in 1924 (Rome), a facsimile edition in 1935 (also Rome), and Hess' commentary in 1995.","Le nove chiese di Roma nelle quali si contengono le historie, pitture, scolture, & architetture di esse.

"Baldini, Umberto","Baldini, Umberto","","1921","2006","Pitigliano, Italy; [near Grosseto]","Marina di Massa, Italy","Italy","male","","","Historian of the Italian Renaissance; headed restoration in Italy after Arno River flood, 1966. Baldini studied art history under Mario Salmi at the University of Florence. In the 1940's began working as a conservator in Florence. After the war, he was appointed a temporary worker in the restoration office in 1949, housed at the time in the loggia of the Uffizi. He rose to Uffizi conservation director, and, during the early morning hours of November 4, 1966, it fell to him to try and prevent the sudden flooding of the Arno River from pouring into the museum's storerooms. Despite personally sandbagging the Uffizi doors (it was a holiday and most museum workers were on vacation), the conservation labs were submerged, damaging more than 1,000 medieval and Renaissance paintings, sculptures and frescoes. Baldini took over the restoration of hundreds of these artworks, not only at the Uffizi, but also in organizing efforts at other museums, libraries and churches. He helped to hire and train hundreds of assistants to dry, clean and restore artworks and worked with experts to develop new restoration techniques. As a result of this campaign, the Florentine state restoration laboratories were merged into the historic 'Opificio dei Medici' (located in a Medici building), which had taken lead role after the 1966 catastrophe. Baldini became the director in 1970 of this new body, now known as the Opificio delle Pietre Dure. He reorganized the museum's new conservation facilities, creating a single institute with training programs for students. In 1972 he organized an exhibition on the conservation works damaged the flood. His important book on conservation-a fundamental work-Teoria del restauro e unità di metodologia, appeared in 1978. Baldini moved to Rome in 1983 as director of the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro, the most important conservation institute in Italy. As director, he and his wife, Ornella Casazza, led the project to clean and restore the Masaccio frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel of the Carmine Church in Florence. Using as their guide colors from a portion of the fresco hidden behind an altar--and very nearly original--the restorers brought Masaccio's masterpiece back to vivid colors, avoiding the kind of criticism later applied to the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Baldini published a book on this project as well, La Cappella Brancacci, in 1990. He retired from the Institute in 1987. However, he continued to write about restoration, and to contribution to conservation in his role as President of the 'Universitá Internazionale dell'Arte' (International University of Art or UIA) in Florence. Using the famous Cimabue Crucifix in the Basilica Santa Croce as the prime example Baldini published Brunelleschi e Donatello nella Sagrestia Vecchia di S. Lorenzo in 1989. Baldini contributed art reviews in Italian art journals, including Critica d'arte, Arte documento, Museologia, Bollettino d'arte, Commentari and Antichità viva. He was president of the Horne Museum, the museum-home of the British historian of Renaissance art, Herbert P. Horne. In 2004 he joined other Italian art historians in authenticating wooden crucifix as an early work of Michelangelo, still controversial. Baldini died after a long illness at the age of 84, shortly before he was to deliver a speech at a conference on the 40th anniversary of the flood. His funeral was held at the church of San Giuseppe Vecchio in Marina di Massa, Tuscany. Baldini was known as an authority on Michelangelo, Botticelli, Masaccio and Della Robbia family. His restoration work was open to criticism, some asserting that the subtleties of the Brancacci frescoes had been effaced. His bold restoration moves during the Arno flood saved countless works; he removed entire frescoes from church walls to protect them from corrosive salts seeping through masonry from basement crypts.","Palazzo Vecchio e i quartieri monumentali.

Baruffaldi was the son of the collector and scholar Nicolò Baruffaldi (1645-1748). He initially attended the Jesuit seminary in Ferrara before studying under his father. He was ordained a priest, then a doctor of philosophy, joining the literary Colonia Ferrarese dell'Arcadia. He wrote historical treatises and poetry under the pseudonym ""Cluento Nettunio."" After publishing a history of the city of Ferrara in 1700, he began working on a biography of Ferrara artists, Vite de' pittori e scultori ferraresi, in 1704, based on the popular model of Giorgio Vasari and more closely Giovanni Baglione. However, he was exiled to the Veneto for political reasons in 1711, and on his return in 1713, other works caught his attention. In addition to poetry and histories, he publish art titles such as Museo Volpiano: baccanale in 1720 and a work on the art of the stations of the cross with Giovanni Andrea Barotti (1701-1772), which appeared in 1732. His history of the University of Ferrara, co-authored with Ferrante Borsetti Ferranti Bolani (1682-1764) was published in 1735. He held a number of university and church appointments. In his capacity as arch-priest of Cento, Baruffaldi became a protector of artists. A project to rebuild the collegiate church together with Alfonso Torreggiani was completed in 1744. However, Baruffaldi died without completing his most important work for art, his Lives, along with over 200 other manuscripts. The first volume of his project had to wait nearly one hundred years after his death to be issued.Vite de' pittori e scultori ferraresi is the first Ferrara art history and remains an important primary source.

Bellori was raised by his uncle, the antiquarian Francesco Angeloni (1559-1652). He studied from Angeloni's private archaeological collection and drawings by Annibale Carracci, and painting (perhaps with Domenichino) though few artworks by Bellori are known. Bellori became Angeloni's heir at Angeloni's death in 1652. He assembled his own collection of paintings, including those by Titian, Tintoretto, [Annibale] Carracci, as well as coins and medals. He assisted on several scholarly publications, including Le Gemme antiche figurate (1657) of Leonardo Agostini. Beginning in 1670 he acted as curator (Commissario dell'Antichità) to the classical collection of Pope Clement X. The following year he became rector (secretary) of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. At the Accedemia he fostered debate on art theory and strengthened the connections with the Académie de France, Rome. Inspired by the biography of artists Le vite de'più eccellenti pittori, scuttori e architetti of Giorgio Vasari (1550, 1568) and Le vite de' pittori, scultori & architetti, 1642, of Giovanni Baglione, Bellori compiled his own biographical collection, Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti moderni (1672) with a theoretical preface which been delivered earlier as a lecture in 1664. Bellor borrowed material from the Baglione's work, whom Bellori wrote was the ""Prometheus of Images"" (O'Neil). But Bellori's motivation was a much jealousy of Baglione, who he privately accused of having the work ghostwritten by the antiquarian Ottavio Tronsarelli (d. 1646). Bellori's work would then ""correct"" Baglione's work, which he said was written out of spite. Bellori acted as librarian and antiquary to the exiled Queen Christina of Sweden in Rome after 1680. He was honorary member of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris in 1689. At his death in 1690, Bellori was buried in San Isidoro, Rome. Bellori's Vite focuses on twelve artists, Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Domenico Fontana, Federico Barocci, Caravaggio, Rubens, van Dyck, Francesco Duquesnoy, Domenichino, Giovanni Lanfranco, Alessandro Algardi and Poussin. His preference for the Bolognese and classical-influenced artists, Annibale, Domenichino and Poussin, is apparent by the length of their biographies. Only two sculptors, Algardi and Duquesnoy, were included. Caravaggio and van Dyck received the scantest treatment and somewhat surprisingly, Bernini not at all. The Vite is noted for its rich description of the individual works of art, something missing in earlier art-historical accounts. Bellori's planned sequel never appeared, but he completed the entries for Guido Reni, Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratti. Maratti (1625-1713) contributed funds for the posthumous publication of Bellori's Descrizzione delle imagini dipinte de Raffaelle d'Urbino (1696), which describe Raphael's Vatican Stanze frescos and the Cupid and Psyche cycle in the Villa Farnesina. Bellori's theorietical section of the Vite is a compilation of Platonic and Aristotelian ideas, drawn from Renaissance authors such as Giovanni Battista Agucchi (1570-1632) and Franciscus Junius. He sought to find middle ground between the Mannerists and the naturalism of Caravaggio. This was embodies in Classical antiquity and the paintings of Raphael, Annibale Carracci, Domenichino and Poussin. Poussin's friendship with Bellori likely influenced the author's writings.","Vite de' pittori, scultori ed architetti moderni.

"Bianchi Bandinelli, Ranuccio","Bianchi Bandinelli, Ranuccio","Conte Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli","1900","1975","Siena, Italy","Rome, Italy","Italy","male","","","Marxist art historian of Roman art. Bianchi Bandinelli was descended from ancient aristocracy in Siena. His father, Mario Bianchi Bandinelli (1859-1930), was a one-time mayor of Siena and land baron whose forebears included Pope Alexander III (served 1159-1181). His mother, Margherita Ottilie ""Lily"" von Korn (Bianchi Bandinelli) (1878-1905) was German from minor noble lineage. He attended the liceo Guicciardini in Siena before entering the University in Rome in 1918, studying archaeology. His early research focused on the Etruscan centers close to his family lands. In 1924 he married Maria Garrone. His thesis, on the Etruscan town of Chiusi (Clusium), appeared in 1926. Another article followed on the Etruscan town of Suana (Sovana) in 1929. He joined the faculty at the Università di Cagliari in 1929 and the following year, University of Pisa. Bianchi Bandinelli sold his family's estate in 1934 after the death of his father, except for a smaller home, the villa Geggiano, where he would live to devote himself entirely to archaeology. He worked at the Museo archeologico in Florence, mapping the Etruscan sites. Between 1931-1933 he taught at the University in classical archeology at Groningen, the Netherlands. In 1935, he and Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti founded the journal Critica d'Arte which, unlike other art journals, was open to all areas of art history, classical to modern. Important contributors to the journal included Roberto Longhi. He was appointed professor at the University in Florence in 1938, but with this, required to take an oath of fascism. His duties during this time including giving a tour of classical objects to Hitler and Mussolini. At the invitation of the German art historian Gerhart Rodenwaldt, Bianchi Bandinelli mounted a conference in Berlin on classical archaeology. His disgust with fascism in Italy grew and he declined to be present for a similar tour for Hermann Goering. His Storicità dell'arte classica, 1943, began a personal interest comprehensive art histories of the classical world. He converted to communism after World War II, and, as an anti-fascist, was appointed to a number of important art-historical positions immediate after the war. This included director of the new government's fine arts and antiquities (Antichità e Belle Arti, Ministerio della Pubblica Istruzione, 1945-1948). As a public official, Bianchi Bandinelli worked to separate Italy's reputation as a fascist country from its art reputation by loaning works to international exhibitions. He quelled post-war fears in Italy when Italian newpapers published erroneous reports that the Allies would demand art treasures from Italy as war reparations. From his chairs at the university of Florence and later Rome, he directed the new breed of Italian archaeologists sensitive to classical history based upon dialectical materialism. He also taught at the university of Groeningen. In the 1950's he returned to his idea of a comprehensive text on classical art for the general, educated public. He founded the Enciclopedia dell'arte antica in 1958. In the mid 1960s, Bianchi Bandinelli was commissioned to write the two volumes on Roman art for the important French Arts of Mankind series. These works brought his writing to a larger audience and helped usher in social criteria for classical art history to a larger and English-speaking audience. In 1967 he founded the periodical Dialoghi di archeologia with his students, one of the most innovative, if controversial, periodicals on classical archaeology. His students included Giovanni Becatti, A. Giuliano, Mario Torelli (b. 1937), Andrea Caladnrini (b. 1937) and Filippo Coarelli (b. 1936). His memoir of fascism in Italy was published after his death in 1995. Bianchi Bandinelli brought a scholarly brand of Marxism to the world of art history in the early 1970s. Eschewing so-called ""crass Marxist"" analysis, his work, most clearly in his English translations of surveys of Roman art, brought his wider set of criteria to English-speaking audiences. His early work on the relationship of Roman art to Greece and Etruscan art drew from the writings of Aloïs Riegl and Franz Wickhoff. His singular interprestations of art--not always compelling--were amply grounded. He viewed the Belvedere Apollo, for example--a Roman copy of a Greek original now thought to be second century--hailed by most art historians as a work the original of which was by Leochares, as a frigid copy of a Hellenistic work without relation to the master. His magazine Critica d'Arte became the model for other Italian art magazines, most notably Prospettiva, founded by Giovanni Previtali and Mauro Cristofani (1941-1997). Bianchi Bandinelli's family castle in Siena was used as a backdrop in the film 1950 film The Deported by Robert Siodmak (1900-1973).","[dissertation:] published, Clusium: Ricerche archeologich e topografiche su Chiusi il suo territorio in età etrusca.

Boni was orphaned early and attended a commercial school in Venice. At nineteen, he assisted in the Doge's Palace restoration, but quarreled with the superintendent of the project, Forcinelli, over the restoration. This led to a crusade against over-zealous restoration. In the course of these activities, he corresponded with John Ruskin and William Morris (1834-1896). He entered the Venice Academy, studying architecture. In 1885 he became a corresponding member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. That same year he began excavation of San Marco. As secretary to the Calcografia in Rome, beginning in 1888, he began duties as an inspector of monuments, helping establish a photographic archive as part of the Ministry of Education. He assisted in the Pantheon excavation in 1892 with L. Beltrami (1854-1933) and the architect (and later designer of the Victor Emmanuel monument) Giuseppe Sacconi (1854-1905). In 1898 he was appointed director of the excavation of the Roman Forum. He demolished the church of Santa Maria Liberatrice in order to expose the ruins of Santa Maria Antiqua. His other discoveries included the Archaic cemetery and portions of the Column of Trajan. During World War I he invented a winter camouflage uniform. Toward the end of his life, he embraced fascism and became a senator in 1923. As an archaeologist, Boni was careful to observe strata to the Forum excavations.

Brandi graduated in with a law degree from the University of Siena in 1927, but his interests had moved to art so much that he wrote a thesis the following year at the University of Florence on the artists Rutilio Manetti, Francesco Vanni, and Ventura Salimbeni. In 1930 he was assigned to the Administration of Antiquities and the Fine Arts to assist the Inspector (Soprintendenza) of Monuments and Galleries of Siena. There he cataloged and reinstalled the collection of the paintings of the Academy of Fine Arts of Siena in its new home in Buonsignori palace. This resulted in Brandi's important 1933 exhibition, ""La Regia pinacoteca di Siena."" The exhibition was a major achievement, documenting the swelling interested in the so-called ""Sienese primitives"" in a well-researched and impartial catalog. The same year he was appointed Inspector to Monuments of Bologna. During his tenure, the city created its first laboratory for art works restoration, again resulting in an important exhibition, ""Mostra della pittura riminese del trecento"" (Exhibition of Painting from Rimini from the 1300's) of 1935. He moved to Rome in 1936 to become the Director of Antiquity and Fine Arts. In 1938 the Italian Minister of Fine Arts, Giulio Carlo Argan, endowed a government institute for restoration, the Istituto Centrale del Restauro (ICR), appointing Brandi, a friend, as its first director. There Brandi developed his theories on the careful restoration and conservation of monuments. The approaching war limited the Institute's activities and it closed in 1945, but reopened shortly thereafter. As director of a major conservation center, Brandi intervened extensively in controversies of restoration. He published numerous articles on modern approaches in conservation, some in English, which were collected in his 1963 Teoria del restauro. Two publications on Duccio one of ca. 1949 and a monograph of 1951 remain his best writing. He retired from the Istituto in 1959.Brandi's methods of conservation allowed him to make chronological assessments based more than on simple art-historical opinion. His date of a pivotal panel of painting in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere as sixth century was questioned by Carlo Bertelli. Brandi's date, however, has subsequently been accepted as correct.

Brizio","19 September 1902","01 August 1982","Sale d’Alessandria, Italy","Rapallo, Italy","Italy","female","","University of Turin,University of Milan","Italian art historian and Professor of medieval and modern art at University of Turin and University of Milan; Scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.

Anna Maria Brizio was born in 1902 in Sale d’Alessandria, Italy. Brizio attended the University of Turin along with fellow Italian historian and art critic, Lionello Venturi. Brizio received her A.B. in 1923 from the University of Turin with a thesis on Defendente Ferrari da Chivasso, at the time she was still focused on the classical painters of the past. After graduation, she attended the Graduate School of Art History at the University of Rome, founded by Lionello Venturi’s father, Adolfo Venturi. Venturi and Brizio eventually collaborated to organize the first exhibition of the Gualino collection in the Regia Pinacoteca di Torino in the 1930s. They also participated in research to support the publication of Italian paintings in America. Brizio’s participation in the “Gualino exhibition” sparked her interest in contemporary art. She found it important to evaluate 19thcentury art with an understanding of the history that underlines contemporary art, especially noting the Impressionist movement, which few in Italy had done.

She then began focusing on Italian painters of the Renaissance, starting with Gaudenzio Ferrari, and then turning her focus to Paolo Veronese. Brizio furthered her connection with the Venturi’s when she became a collaborator for their magazine, L’Arte. She was the editor of L’Arte from 1930 to 1938. Once the Venturis’ moved away from their magazine, Brizio began her project for U.T.E.T., an Italian publishing company, which was Ottocento Novecento. It was the last volume of the universal history of art series published by U.T.E.T, but was the first to be published in the late 1930s. It was also considered part of a nationalistic approach that highlighted Italian painting in the 19th century. In 1939 she published one of her most famous works, Nineteenth and Twentieth Century. This book addressed the fascist regime. Starting in 1946, she taught History of medieval and modern art at the University of Turin. While she taught at Turin she directed the Galleria Sabauda (1936-1947), organized exhibitions, and collaborated with the UTET Great Encyclopedic Dictionary. Her contributions to the UTET are considered some of her most important contributions to 20th century historical-artistic studies. Later, Brizio began to focus on Leonardo da Vinci, culminating in the Selected Writings of Leonardo da Vinci in 1952. Brizio transferred to the University of Milan to be the chair of Medieval and Modern Art in 1957. She was also an important scholar of Leonardo da Vinci, also editing Leonardo da Vinci’s “Treaty of Painting.” During this time, she was urged to publish a second edition of her Ottocento Novecento,  but she became more interested in abstract expressions and the relationship between art and human life. She retired in 1979 but remained as chair to the Corrente Foundation, which highlighted the period of time in art history when the Corrente Movement was developed. Brizio died August 1st, 1982 in Rapallo, Italy.

Brizio studied and excavated at the sites of Pompeii and the Roman Forum (Forum Romanum) in Rome. His association with Enrico Brunn at the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) taught him formal analysis of Greek art, the basis for his later art history. He traveled to Greece in 1874. In 1876 he was named chair at the University of Bologna for archaeology and numismatics. His lectures exposed his students to the German stylistic analysis. At this time, be began a life's passion: the question about populations in prehistoric Italy. His theory about Etruscans put him at odds with many in the archaeological community. Count Giovanni Gozzadini (1810-1887) had postulated that the Etruscans had come from the Villanova, but Brizio insisted that Etruscans had come from the east after the Villanovan period. He also chided Gozzadini for his failure to recognize Marzabotto as a city, rather than the necropolis which Gozzadini claimed. His bitterest feuds came against Antonio Zannoni (1833-1910) regarding the objects of Certosa and against Wolfgang Helbig, who insisted that Etruscans had come from the north instead of eastern regions. As an archaeologist and ex officio director of the Museo Civico in Bologna, he oversaw the timely excavation reports on the sites of Verucchio, Montefortino, Marzabotto and Bologna.","Pitture e sepolcri scoperti sull'Esquilino dalla Compagnia fondiaria italiana nell'anno 1875.

Bucarelli studied art history at the University of Rome under Adolfo Venturi and Pietro Toesca. After graduation, she joined the department of Antiquities and Fine Arts, part of the Ministry of Education. She remained at the department as fascism overtook Italy. At the height of World War II, she assumed the directorship of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome, in 1942. Her efforts saved the collection from the air raids. As the Allies entered Italy and the Fascist Ministry moved to Padua, Bucarelli remained in Rome with her museum. She watched as colleagues, including Giulio Carlo Argan were dismissed by the government for failing to take a fascist oath of loyalty. By 1944, she reopned the museum, restoring works by non-Italian artists which had been removed during the Fascist Era for nationalist sentiment. After the War, she organized shows. Bucarelli solicited the advice of prominet art critics and scholars such as Corrado Maltese (1921-2001), Nello Ponente and Maurizio Calvesi (b. 1927) to advise on acquitisions. These included the Futurist movement, Italian mainstream modernists such as Modigliani, Moranti and Savinio, as well as Abstract Art from Italy and the West. She launched a major Picasso show at the Gallery in 1953. Her 1954 Alberto Burri exhibition brought a controversy in the Italian Parliament, when members considered him a foreigner to have a show in the national museum. Other exhibitions included Piet Mondrian in 1956, Jackson Pollock in 1958 (a year before the artist's death), Casimir Malevich in 1959 and Mark Rothko in 1962. That same year she bought a Van Gogh for the gallery, ""The Woman from Arles"" only the second held in a public Italina collection. Her catalog on Jean Fautrier, published in 1960, remains an important work. During her tenure she secured Luigi Cosenza as architect for the new wing of the gallery. She married the journalist and writer Paolo Monelli (1894-1984) in 1963. Bucarelli retired from the Gallery in 1975, donating her personal collection of paintings to the Gallery in 1996. She died in 1998 at the age of eighty in a Rome hospital.

Causa attended the University of Naples completing his studies with a thesis on the 17th-century Neapolitan painter Micco Spadaro (1609-1675). In 1946 Causa was appointed Ispettore of the Soprintendenza (Naples), where he remained until 1965. During his tenure, he supervised restorations, organized exhibitions and produced art-historical studies of considerable interest. He organized the important exhibition ""Bozzetti napoletani del Sei e del Settecento"" in 1947 where he described and analyzed the figure of the painter Luca Giordano (1634-1705). Causa became a member of the editorial staff of Paragone Arte, the art review founded by Roberto Longhi. In 1954 he organized, in collaboration with his friend, the specialist in 15th-century art and professor Ferdinando Bologna, the original exposition ""Scultura lignea"" and the important catalog, Sculture lignee nella Campania. In 1956 he was one of the member of the staff for the reorganization of Pinacoteca Nazionale of Naples in its new seat at Capodimonte, under Bruno Molajoli (1905-1985). In 1962 he focused his research on Certosa di San Martino and he wrote Tarsie cinquecentesche nella certosa di S. Martino a Napoli, 1962. He wrote important studies about Anton Sminck Pitloo (1790-1837), a Dutch painter who was invited to Naples by the Russian diplomat and art connoisseur Count Grigory Vladimirovich Orloff and became one of the founding members of School of Posillipo, a group of landscape painters that worked en plein air. He wrote numerous articles and books in which discussed themes ranging from Caravaggio (e.g. I seguaci del Caravaggio a Napoli, 1966.) to various Neapolitan painters (e.g. Pittura napoletana dal XV al XIX secolo, 1957), especially those of still life. He wrote reviews in Italian art journals including Napoli nobilissima, Paragone Arte, Emporium, Bollettino d'arte, Arte veneta and international journals e.g. The Art Quarterly. After his appointment as Soprintendente in 1965, he organized important international exhibitions such as the ""Civiltà del Settecento a Napoli"" (1979) and ""La pittura napoletana da Caravaggio a Luca Giordano"" (1984), which traveled internationally. He contributed two volumes to the 10-volume survey Storia di Napoli, beginning 1972 Neapolitan 18th-century painters, La pittura del Seicento a Napoli: dal naturalismo al barocco. He was also a member of the Scientific Committee of the project with the historians Franco Venturi (1914-1994) and Giuseppe Galasso (b. 1929), the archaeologist Domenico Mustilli (1899-1966), etc. Causa oversaw two exhibitions in his final years which traveled to American museums ""The Age of Caravaggio"" at the Metropolitan Museum, 1985, and ""Bernardo Cavallino of Naples, 1616-1656"" at Cleveland and Fort Worth, TX. He died unexpectedly at the age of 61 while working on the exhibition, ""La pittura napoletana da Caravaggio a Luca Giordano.""

"Cellini, Benvenuto","Cellini, Benvenuto ","","1500","1571","Florence, Italy","Florence, Italy","Italy","male","","","Mannerist sculptor; his autobiography (Vita) contains evaluations of many renaissance artists. Trained as a goldsmith, Cellini worked primarily as a sculptor. His early work in Pisa on the cathedral (accidentally, he had originally set out for Rome) resulted in a keen knowledge of Roman sculpture via sarcophagi. Finally in Rome by 1519, he dealt in antique medals, gems, and other objects which, according to his autobiography, he routinely discovered. In 1532 he traveled to Naples before a commission for the Cardinal Ippolito d'Este (1479-1520) led him to the court of Francois I in Fontainebleau in 1540. At Fontainebleau, Cellini worked on royal commissions, including a famous Nymph of Fontainebleau, now in the Louvre [the work was only reattributed to Cellini by Leopoldo Conte Cicognara in 1824]. In 1543 he produced his most famous work of art, the Salt Cellar of Francois I, a gold and enamel salt holder for royal use. Thereafter, Cellini returned to Florence to work for for Cosimo I de' Medici. These included his notable bronze Perseus statue. In 1556 he was imprisoned in the Stinche for more than two months for assault. He was charged with sodomy in 1557. It was during this time, when, sentenced to four years' imprisonment and under house arrest, (or possibly the following year) that Cellini began his Vita, an important proto-art-historical work. He likely intended his autobiography both as an apologia as well as a document of his accomplishments. The manuscript, which was dictated in 1562 to an assistant while Cellini sculpted, was unpublishable at the time because of his strained relations with Cosimo I. Cellini appears to have added sections to it around 1566-7. The Vite remained unpublished during Cellini's lifetime, though contemporaries such as Giorgio Vasari, himself an important art-historical chronicler, knew of its existence. Benedotto Varchi, another in the Medici circle, may also have read it. The manuscript was believed lost, though imperfect 17th-century copies existed. These copies circulated to Filippo Baldinucci and Antonio Cocchi, who issued an edition in 1728. The first English translation appeared in 1771 by Thomas Nugent, who had used the Cocchi version. Goethe translated it into German. The rediscovery of the original manuscript in 1805 allowed Francesco Tassi to issue a reliable edition in 1829. Though many events appear to be ""reconstructions,"" perhaps in the hopes of reingratiating himself with the Medici, the account overall is a more or less truthful document. Cellini's life forms a privileged snapshot of artistic life in the art capital of the time. He faced interrogations in the Castel Sant'Angelo in 1538, encountered bizarre scenes of witchcraft in the Colosseum, and had dealings with many famous artists and patrons. The Vita is part of a tradition of Italian humanistic biography. Cellini's style is immediate, his facility for dialogue sensitive. His romancing of episodes and impossible chronologies has led to accusations of fiction. Cellini freely discusses the oneiric aspects of life (hallucinations, visions, premonitions) as well as his experience with other renaissance artists and his frank evaluation of them. Modern organization into chapters and sub-parts, which makes for easier reading, is not part of the original structure. Cellini also wrote a treatise on art, not connected with an art history.","[Original manuscript:] Florence, Bib. Medicea-Laurenziana, Cod.

"Cesnola, Luigi Palma di","Cesnola, Luigi Palma di ","Sulpice Boisserée","1832","1904","Rivarolo, Italy; [near Turin]","New York, NY, USA","Italy","male","","","First director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art 1879-1904. Cesnola was born to family of distant Piedmontese nobility. He was trained as a military officer, fighting for the Sardininan Army of Revolution and British in the Crimean War. In 1861 he immigrated to the United States where he married Mary Isabel Reid, the daughter of war hero Commodore Samuel Chester Reid (1783-1861). Cesnola fought in the American Civil War, attaining the rank of colonel in the cavalry. He was captured in 1863 leading a charge of the 4th New York Cavalry at Aldie, Virginia. In 1865 he was appointed by President Lincoln to serve as the U.S. Consul to Cyprus, then under Ottoman occupation. He took up excavations, claiming to have dug more than fifty sites, but for certain making finds in Dali, Atheniu (Golgoi), Paphos, amathus and Kourion (Curium). He exhumed over 35,000 objects, around 22,000 of which he sold the the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. A master promoter, other objects were sold in high-profile auctions in London and Paris. After his duty as Consul concluded in 1877, he was made a trustee of the Metropolitan the same year. Cesnola wrote an account of his exploits, entitled Cyprus (1879) and the same year he was appointed the first professional director of the Metropolitan. He remained there until his death. He led the museum to its new location at Fifth Avenue in Central Park in 1880, his Cyrprian collections occupying the principal location on the first floor. Perhaps for these reasons, the art dealer Gaston Feuardent (1843-1893) accused Cesnola in the journal Art Amateur of having made ""deceptive restorations"" to the Cyprian objects. After a public exchange of comments, Feuardent sued for libel. Although Cesnola was acquitted, court documents indicate much of what Feuardent asserted was correct. Additional accusations of corrupt provenance were hurled by Max Hermann Ohnefalsch-Richter and eventually contained in a report to the Museum by the art journalist William James Stillman. In 1888, Cesnola demanded his curator, William Henry Goodyear to authenticate some Cypriot vases which Goodyear found ""problematic."" Furious when his curator would not do as ""his superior"" demanded, Cesnola locked Goodyear out of his office until Goodyear resigned. Cesnola rankled other staff by strutting the halls and focusing on staff punctuality rather than art. Shortly before his death, Cesnola was instrumental in arranging the return of the Ascoli cope, which had been stolen from the church in Ascoli and unwittingly purchased by J. P. Morgan (1837-1913), to Italy. He died at his apartment in the Seymour Hotel at age 72. After his death in 1904, Cesnola was succeeded at the Metropolitan by Caspar Purdon Clarke of the South Kensington Museum. He is buried in Kenisco cemetery, Valhalla, NY. Cesnola is much criticized for the adventurer/archaeologist he was. Even according to the casual standards of amateur nineteenth century archaeology, Cesnola was guilty of much. He was rarely present at the excavation carried out on his behalf, did not use photographic documentation, and willfully misinterpreted the objects to make them more important than they were. He forged the discovery locations of his finds, partly because he was not present and partly to heighten their luster. The later analysis of his collection by Sir John Myres (1869-1954), however, concluded that all objects were at least of Cyprian origin. A man of bombast and savvy, Cesnola assumed the title ""General"" during his Consulship, although his rank even after discharge was never higher than colonel. The Cesnola Collection of Cypriot items was quietly dissolved in the twentieth century by the Museum, except for the most authentic pieces.","Cyprus: its Ancient Cities, Tombs, and Temples: a Narrative of Researches and Excavations During Ten Years' Residence in that Island.

Cicognara was educated in Modena at the Collegio dei Nobili. As a young man he knew the sculptor Antonio Canova. In 1788 he moved to Rome where he was admitted to the Società dell'Arcadia. There he studied art with Domenico Corvi (1721-1803) and the German painter Jacob Philipp Hackert (1737-1807). In addition, he gained an enthusiasm for classical ruins and contemporary art theory. A member of the Italian nobility, Cicognara involved himself initially in politics with the risorgimento of Italy in the late eighteenth century. He held such posts as deputy to the Congress of Lyons (1801), and Councilor of State. He was briefly incarcerated when warring factions found him guilty of conspiracy. In 1805 he left political life to devote himself to the arts. Cicognara wrote several tracts on esthetics, including Del Bello, ragiomenti sette (1808), which caught the attention of the newly founded Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. He became the Academy's director, using this position to research and publish further in the fine arts. Inspired by the early art histories of Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Seroux d'Agincourt, he published a three-volume history of sculpture, Storia delta scultura between 1813 and 1818. More than a mere chronology of art or a collection of biographical anecdotes, his history of sculpture weaves history, literary and political events into a cogent text. For this accomplishment, Cicognara was awarded foreign member's status from the Institute of France. Beginning in 1815, he issued his survey of the monuments of Venice, which brought him international recognition. These volumes, learned guides to the city, were quickly translated into French as well as a second, updated Italian version. Perhaps because of his early career in politics, Cicogarna maintained that the Accademia's primary role was to serve the public. He was a motivating force in opening the museum associated with the Academy, (Gallerie dell'Accademia) in 1817. In the 1820s, Cicognara renewed a friendship with Canova, the sculptor carving his image in 1822 and the author completing a biography of Canova in 1823. Throughout his collecting and writing, Cicognara amassed a fabulous art library. In 1821 he published what might be today his most consulted book, the inventory of his own library. Catalogo ragionato dei libri d'arte is a snapshot of the available literature on art and art history. In its own time, the collection's value was evident enough for the Pope to purchase Cicognara's library in 1824. It remains a discrete collection housed in the Vatican today. In his final years, Cicognara wrote and researched on the enamel work known as calcography (niello). The popularity of this work created a demand for this genre of art, so much so that fakes were created and sold as part of the Count's collection. After Cicognara's death, his collection of fifteenth and sixteenth century engravings of calcographic pictures were assembled by his nephew, Count Nanetti, and Ch. Albrizzi, under the title, The First Century of Calcography (1837). Among Cicognara's contributions as an art historian were his recognition in 1824 that the spectacular Nymph of Fontainebleau was by Benvenuto Cellini.

Condivi came from a merchant family in Ripatransone where he was raised. He attended school there for five years beginning in 1537. He moved to Rome around 1545, where he met the senior Michelangelo and entered his workshop. During the same time that Giorgio Vasari wrote his first edition of his Le vite de più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori (Lives of the Artists), 1550, Condivi determined to write a biography solely of Michelangelo. This became his Vita di Michelagnolo Buonarroti, which appeared in 1553. Scholars today believe Michelangelo virtually dictated the entire text to Condivi (Gilbert). After a rich biography, Condivi ends with a series of anecdotes to illustrate the notion of respect that Michelangelo achieved in his own time. Vasari used Condivi's Vita to rewrite and correct the account that had appeared his own book for a second edition of 1568. In one extant edition of Condivi's book, an acquaintance clearly close to Michelangelo corrects some facts, giving us an account of the artist as well as recounting Condivi's difficulty in separating the myths from the truth of the artist already with many legends around him. In 1554 Condivi married the niece of Annibale Caro (1507-1566), a friend of Michelangelo; possibly Annibale may have been the true author of the Condivi's Vita. Condivi returned to painting in his home in Ripatransone in 1554. As an artist, Condivi had ""an appalling degree of incompetence"" (Wilde), even when Michelangelo assisted him. A Virgin and Child with Saints (after a cartoon by Michelangelo) is today housed at the Casa Buonarroti, Florence and a fresco is at the church of San Savio in Ripatransone. He died as the result of an accident in 1574.Condivi's Vita contests the biography in the first edition of Vasari, including Michelangelo's arrogance and homosexuality. Condivi's contrived genealogy, though doubted by all scholars, attests to his closeness to Michelangelo, who, like Michelangelo, was self-conscious of his own illegitimacy. His omission of the artist's training, both in Ghirlandaio's studio and his contact with Bramante, continues the contemporary aura of Michelangelo as the complete, i.e., self-contained, genius. However, the one autograph letter known of Condivi shows a writer of significant inarticulation. The Vita's high literary qualities has suggested to some that the work was written or co-authored by Caro (Wilde). A promised edition of Michelangelo's poetry by Condivi apparently never materialized.","Vita di Michelagnolo Buonarroti. Rome: A. Blado,1553, English, Wohl, Helmut, ed. The Life of Michelangelo.

"Croce, Benedetto","Croce, Benedetto","Benedetto Croce","1866","1952","Pescasséroli, Abruzzi, Italy","Naples, Italy","Italy","male","","","Historian and important esthetician for art history. Croce was born to Pasquale Croce and Luisa Siparia, a wealthy land-owning couple and raised in a Roman Catholic boarding school. At age sixteen in 1883 he and his family were buried in their home in Ischia during the Casamicciola earthquake of only he and his brother survived. He lived with an uncle in Rome, the politician Silvio Spaventa (1822-1893), who introduced him to art, intellectuals and politics. After briefly attending the University of Rome studying law, he quit college settling in Naples in 1886. Able to live on his inheritance, he traveled and read. Reading the work of Gianbattista Vico (1668-1744) led him to consider the nature of art and history, and eventually to philosophy. The fundamental questions of history, whether history as a process was an art or a science, engaged him. In 1893-1894 lectures at the Academia Pontiniana in Naples, he concluded, against the prevailing German historians Johann Gustav Droysen (1808-1884) and Ernst Bernheim (1850-1942), that it was more an art since it depended on how individuals interpreted events. Croce published this in 1896 as Il concetto della storia nelle sue relazioni col concetto dell'arte (the idea of history and its relationship to the idea of art). During this time he met the philosopher Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944). Gentile's philosophy was another of the early great influences on Croce's scholarship. The writing of the art historian Robert Vischer, especially his Kunstgeschichte und Humanismus: Beiträge zur Klärung (1880), which made a plea for melding the disciplines of philosophy and art history, also influenced Croce. Croce's reading lead to his 1902 book on esthetics, Estetica come scienza dell'espressione e linguistica generale. Among other assertions, Croce wrote that those who interpret art, critics, viewers, etc., discern the meaning of the work of art only by inserting themselves in the artist's original situation, by what he termed reenacting the artistic impulse of ""intuition."" In later writing, Croce modified his idea of artistic intuition, terming it ""lyrical"" intuition and later even ""cosmic"". The ideas of Estetica occupied him in one form or another the rest of his life. In 1903 Croce and Gentile founded the periodical La critica which became an important literary magazine of the era. He published other works on esthetics, including La poesia. A book on Hegel appeared in 1907. Croce always took an interest in Italian politics. He was early on impressed with the principles of Marxism, but never embraced communism. In 1910 he was elected a senator in the Italian parliament. Croce's clearest theory of art appeared in his 1912 lecture at the inauguration of the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas. Published in 1913 as Breviario di estetica (the Essence of Aesthetic) and in 1915 in English as ""The Breviary of Aesthetic,"" it was there that he made the famous claim of the primacy of art over science or metaphysics, contending that art edifies. He married Adele Rossi in 1914. As a member of the Italian parliament, he vigorously opposed Italy's entrance into World War I. Though this made him unpopular at the time, after Italy's defeat, he was held in high esteem. Croce was appointed the Minister of Education in 1920 under prime minister Giovanni Giolitti. When the Fascists took power, Croce left the Education Ministry in 1921. He declined Mussolini's offer to rejoin it in 1924. The following year, Croce read a paper in Zürich using the concept of the baroque, subsequently published in a German translation as Der Begriff des Barock. die Gegenreformation. zwei Essays. It was a vehement protest of the current German theories of the baroque as an emerging area of art worth studying. Croce argued for the term's original meaning, that of baroque ugliness. The essay appeared in the original Italian version in nearly an identical form as chapters 1 and 2 of Storia dell' Età barocca in Italia in 1929. However, by then, Croce tempered his view, describing Giambattista as an artist very much to his taste. He broke with Gentile (who considered himself the ""philosopher of fascism"") continuing to oppose Benito Mussolini. Croce was too well-respected world-wide and too distant in Naples) for he dictator to arrest. After Mussolini's demise in 1943, Croce worked to assemble a new republican post-war government. Croce was responsible for rescuing the magnificent art library of the German center for classical research, the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut (or DAI) which had been seized by the Italians during the war, eventually turning it over to Walther Amelung. He was the Italian Liberal Party president between 1943 and 1947. In 1946 he became a Constituent Assembly member. He founded a center for the study of Italian history in Naples, the Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Storici in 1947. After his retirement the same year, Croce was named a Senator of the Republic of Italy. He died of influenza at age 86 at his home. Early on, Croce developed a large personal library which was the basis for much of his writing. It was bequeathed to the Istituto. His daughter, Elena Craveri Croce (b. 1915), translated many important German art texts (including Vischer essays) into Italian. Though Croce's early career was art-historical, he was not an art historian in the strict definition of the term. His writings on art theory and his historical research were highly influential on his generation of art historians. His foundational theory from the German Idealists, Fichte, Hegel, etc., found acceptance with the art-historical practice emerging as a formal discipline in German-speaking countries. In Estetica come scienza dell'espressione e linguistica generale, Croce asserted that objects are esthetically interpreted though human ""intuitions"" or ""representations"" which give the otherwise neutral objects meaning. Understanding literature, visual arts and music are all acts of ""intuition,"" Croce insisted, which make them intelligible from the other sensations to which humans are subjected. Croce's assertion that artistic importance had little to do with beauty--that a painting of an ugly person could be a fine painting--allowed art historians to accept many artifacts previous deemed unworthy of study as still important for the history of art. His most succinct comments on the history of art are included in Section 4 of Croce's Brevary of Art (1912), ""Criticism and the History of Art."" The British esthetician R. G. Collingwood (1889-1943) admired his work, translated his autobiography, and brought Croce's ideas to the English speaking world. In the United States, Croce's thought was popularized by the book Art as Experience (1934), by John Dewey (1859-1952). Croce's concept of ""organic unity"" found adherents in the United States in African-American art critic and Columbia University professor Joel E. Spingarn (1875-1939). Personally, he maintained close intellectual friendships with, among others, leader of the so-called second Vienna School of art history, Julius Alwin von Schlosser, who translated his Baroque essays into German, as well as with Adolfo Venturi, his son, Lionello Venturi and Roberto Pane; his writing was crucial to the work of many other art historians, including Giulio Carlo Argan, Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti and Roberto Longhi.","[works pertinent to art history] Estetica come scienza dell'espressione e linguistica generale: teoria e storia.

Pericule Ducati grew up in a bourgeois family originally from Trento. He attended the University of Bologna studying Greek and Latin literature under Giosuè Carducci (1835-1907) and archaeology under Edoardo Brizio. According to the Italian XIX century academic model, he studied classical archaeology at various universities including, in particular, Rome where he studied under the Italian art historian Luigi Pigorini (q.v.) and ancient Roman topography under Rodolfo Lanciani. His 1903 dissertation on classical sculpture involved one of the concepts that would occupy him his entire life: the transmission of antique iconography in other cultures. In 1906-1907 he visited southwestern Greece in order to observe archaeological classical tradition and to study history of Greek pottery under the Austrian researcher Emanuel Löwy (1857 -1938). After a brief appointment as Ispettore ai Musei e Scavi (1909), he was named to the chair in classical archaeology in Catania in 1912. He moved to a professorship in Turin and finally to Bologna in 1920. There he combined his teaching position with that of director of the Museo Civico. As Brizio and Löwy had imparted to him, he employed an academic German tradition of instruction scheme providing a clear and general preparatory course and more specific monographic part. The latter pedogogical technique was marked by visits to the local museums in accordance with the Vienna School teaching tradition. In 1920 he was appointed Classical archaeological history Professor at University of Bologna. He was twice Dean of the Faculty of Arts in Bologna (1923-1929 and 1943-1944), and also Member of the Accademia dei Lincei and he was a member of the High Council for Antiquities and Fine Arts of Italy. Ducati collaborated with the fascist government of Benito Mussolini, less, some say, out of a political than for the need to remain researching in his field. His political affiliations clearly forced his hand, however, in publications. In 1927 he wrote Origine e attributi del Fascio littorio, a book sponsored by the Association for Fascist Schools Libraries in Italy. He was a member to the PFR (partito fascista repubblicano) and was President of the Fascist Culture Institute of Italy. In the 1930s, he was selected by the Classical archaeologist J. D. Beazley and the Greek vase painting scholar Paul Jacobsthal to write a volume in their Bilder griechischer Vasen series, Pontische Vasen (1932). After the declaration of World War II, he was ambushed outside his home in Bologna on the Via Albertazzi, and struck by several bullets by the Italian partisans. He was transferred by a German ambulance to the hospital Codivilla heliotherapy Cortina d'Ampezzo (BL), where he died two months later of a related infection. Ducati is buried in the cemetery of Bologna. A portion of his library was donated to the Biblioteca Universitaria of Bologna as well as his letters and manuscripts. Ducati's use of unorthodox sources and highly individual research attracted scholars who sought to reinvent the discipline themselves. These included the art historian Luciano Laurenzi (q.v.), who wrote a commemoration of Ducati, the archaeologist Maurizio Corradi Cervi (1904-1982), and Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli."," L'arte classica: con 12 tavole in rotocalco e 949 riproduzioni d'arte nel testo, Nuova rist. corretta della 3. ed. interamente riveduta, Torino: Unione Tip.-Ed.

Facio was educated in Verona under Guarino Guarini and later (by late 1420s) studied Greek in Florence. He held several initial posts in Genoa and Lucca, before being named Genoese envoy to Naples in 1443. By 1445 he was in the employ of King Alfonso of Naples where he secured the job of royal historian and tutor to Prince Ferrante. After various translations and essays on happiness and the dignity of man, Facio issued his De viris illustribus in 1456, over ninety lives of his contemporaries organized by their professions. These included the architect Leon Battista Alberti (under ""orators"") and Gentile da Fabriano, Jan van Eyck, Pisanello and Rogier van der Weyden. under ""painters."" Facio introduced these biographies with a discussion of literature and art, broadly based upon the Ars poetica of Horace and the Prooemium by Philostratus the younger. As an art theorist, Facio praised verisimilitude and feeling, similar to contemporary rhetoricians. A painting's ability to express emotion elevated that painter to the highest level in Facio's view. As a biographer, he was one of the first author to discuss the works of the northern renaissance artists, proving for modern historians (Jan) van Eyck's popularity in Italy. Facio mentions many paintings of the Eyck in Italy unknown today, including a St. Jerome panel in the Lomellini Triptych and another of women bathing notable for its effect of appearing to be in a mirror. He praised Rogier van der Weyden's decorous rendering of the sitter's character and underlying emotion. Among Italian masters, Facio praised Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello. In addition, he lists three sculptors, Lorenzo Ghiberti and his son, Vittorio, and Donatello.","De viris illustribus (manuscript,. 1456), published as Mehus, Laurentius.

"Filarete","Filarete","Antonio di Pietro Averlino","c. 1400","c. 1469","Florence, Italy","Rome, Italy","Italy","male","","","Sculptor and architect, theorist who wrote on the origins of architecture. Antonio di Pietro Averlino assumed the name Filarete, adopted from the Greek term for ""lover of excellence"" (φιλάρετος). Filarete is first documented, already an artist, in 1433 in Rome, where he attended the coronation of the Emperor Sigismund. Pope Eugenius IV commissioned him to create the bronze door of the main porch of the old St. Peter's (dated, 1445). In 1451 Filarete moved to Milan at the invitation of the Duke Francesco Sforza (1401-1466). There he worked as an architect and architectural theorist. His most important work was the Ospedale Maggiore. He remained in Milan until 1465. In Milan Filarete wrote Trattato di architettura somewhere between 1461 and 1464. The Trattato, unlike the architectural treatises of Vitruvius or Alberti, is written as a court dialogue between an architect and his patron. Its importance as architectural history lies in his remarks on the origin of architecture--an proto architectural history--and the anthropomorphic proportions it postulates. Following Vitruvius, Filarete conceived domestic houses as the first architecture, speculating that Adam, as the first man, was also the first architect. The human head was therefore the basic unit for architectural measurement. Filarete continued his architectural theory with the orders of architecture (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), reversing Vitruvius: the Doric column is nine, the Ionic seven and the Corinthian eight heads high. Following Vitruvius and Alberti he organized a history of buildings into public--subdivided into religious and secular--and private constructions. Filarete created a historical category, dividing structures between contemporary and ancient buildings, though the examples he uses are all fantastic or utopian. Like his fellow architectural historian/theorists Antonio Manetti di Marabottin and Giorgio Vasari, Filarete sees Gothic architecture as barbaric, contrasting it against the civilized architecture of antiquity that serves as a model for the buildings of Sforzinda, the visionary ideal city named after Duke (Grodecki). The Trattato di architettura was the first treatise on architecture in the Renaissance written in Italian, i.e., the vernacular instead of Latin and illustrated (Werdehausen). It remains an important work in the development of Renaissance architectural theory. It remained in manuscript. In the late 19th century it was published but by then the original had been lost. The Codex Magliabechianus copy (Florence, Bib. N. Cent., MS. ii. i. 140) is considered the closest to Filarete's original.","","Spencer, John R.

"Fiocco, Giuseppe","Fiocco, Giuseppe","","1884","1971","Giacciano, Rovigo, Italy","Padua, Italy","Italy","male","","","Pioneer of art history in the Veneto area; first chair of art history at the University of Padua. Fiocco received his undergraduate degree (laurea) at Rome University in 1904 in jurisprudence. After winning the Vittorio Emanuele Prize to the University of Bologna, Faculty of Letters, he returned to the University of Rome studying art history under Adolfo Venturi.His important publication appeared in 1911 as the article, ""Di alcune opere dimenticate di Sebastiano Del Piombo,"" in the Bollettino d 'Art. The following year he announced his interest in Paolo Vernese, a life interest, with his article, ""Paolo Farinati e le sue opere per il Frassino,"" published in Venturi's periodical L'Arte. He joined the Soprintendenza alle Gallerie di Venezia. In 1924 his first article in English for the Burlington Magazine (""'A Historical Titian"") appeared, thereby attracting an international reputation for him. He moved within the Soprintendenza to Florence in 1925. The following year he was appointed to the Chair of the History of Art in the University of Florence. A monograph on Veronese, published in 1928 in Bologna; it remains an important contribution to the study of that artist's work. In 1929 the University of Padua created a Chair of Art History and Fiocco became its first occupant. From this position at Padua, Fiocco trained some of the most important Italian art historians of the next generation. His interests ranged from minor artists, such as Lattanzio da Rimini and Domenico da Tolmezzo to major artists and the history of sculpture and architecture. Fiocco's principal interests, however, were the artists of Venice and the Veneto. He wrote important studies on Falconetto, Fra Giocondo, and Zelotti. His book on Carpaccio, published in Rome in 1930, remains a standard work on the artist. A second book on Vernese was published in 1934 in Rome. His book on Pordenone, 1939, is ""a model definition in depth of an artist of the second rank"" (Mullaly). A substantial part of his energies in his later years went to the Fondazione Giorgio Cini, a research center devoted to the scholarly study of art. Shortly before his death Fiocco opened the exhibition of 'Disegni veronesi del Cinquecento' in Venice. His students included Rodolfo Pallucchini. Fiocco can be seen as the last of the founders of Italian art history, G. B. Cavalcaselle, [Adolfo] Venturi, and Bernard Berenson scholars who defined the shape of Italian art. When Fiocco began the study of art history, the discipline was principally based upon connoisseur's intuition. While he kept these skills, he founded the Fondazione Cini to foster a scientific study of Venetian art, including a research library and photo archives. Later practitioners of the discipline, such as Roberto Longhi, only six years his junior, developed new critical working methods still widely pursued. Methodologically, Fiocco's attention to detail, perhaps springing from his legal training, was his hallmark. Iconographical problems, though important, were never the whole story for him. He focused on an artistic personality, placing in a cultural context. He was a prolific writer of certificates of authenticity of pieces, many of which have been subsequently discredited. His work on the problem of the figure paintings in Francesco Guardi and Gian Antonio Guardi was controversial.","","Bazin, Germain. Histoire de l'histoire de l'art: de Vasari à nos jours.

François traveled widely as a young man. In 1825 he elected to excavate Etruscan sites, beginning with Cosa (until 1828) and then at Cortona in 1843. He also worked at digs in Volterra, Fiesole, Vetulonia, Populonia, Chiusi and Vulci. In 1844 François discovered black-figure vase fragments at Fonte Rotelle near Chiusi in the vicinity of several plundered tombs. The spectacular sherds immensely impressed the archaeologist Arcangelo Michele Migliarini (1779-1865), who encouraged François to search for more fragments. In 1845 François recovered five more pieces. The pieces were assembled by Vincenzo Monni and Giovan Gualberto Franceschi into a complete vase. The size and quality of the vase made it an immediate sensation. Leopoldo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, purchased it for the Uffizi in 1846. Emil Braun, first secretary of the Archaeological Institute of Rome, was the first to published it. An additional piece was discovered and donated to the museum by Carlo Strozzi. François, who worked as the commissary of war for the Duke, had an abiding dream to found a museum comprising his finds. Together with the epigrapher A. Noël des Vergers (1805-1867) he created his own excavation society. He kept his finds in his home in Florence. When numerous attempts to found a public museum failed in Italy, he turned to the French government, also without success. In 1857 François made a second great find, an Etruscan painted tomb, now believed to be fourth century. Once again official interest in establishing a museum of his collection grew. François fell ill however and died the same year, never able to fulfill his dream. François lent his name to two important monuments in art history: the François Vase and François Tomb. A major monument in the history of Greek pottery, the François Vase is a large (66 cm) volute krater in a black-figure design, signed both by the potter, Ergotimos, and the painter, Kleitias. The Attic work has been dated to 570 B. C. In 1900, a disgruntled museum guard threw a stool at the case and smashed the François Vase to pieces (638!). It was restored in by Pietro Zei, incorporating the Strozzi fragment, but missing another piece which had been stolen. That piece was returned in 1904. A new reconstruction was performed in 1973. Today the krater is located in the Florence Archaeological Museum.","[François left no published writing].","""François, Alessandro."" Encyclopedia of the History of Classical Archaeology.

He worked as the librarian of the Biblioteca Chigiana. In 1790 he edited the first of two important archival publications, Miscellanea filogica. The following year he began excavating at Ardea, which launched his career as an archaeologist. Napoleon's conquest of the region forced him into exile and prison. However, his appointment as Commissario delle Antichit à in 1800 by Pope Pius VII outwardly vindicated him of the charges. He remained in this capacity until his death in 1836. In 1801 he was appointed president of the Capitoline Museum. Fèa was responsible for the 1802 antiquities regulations that stimulated new archaeological investigations of major Roman monuments, including the Arch of Constintine, Arch of Septimus Severus and the Flavian ampitheater (Colosseum). He personally worked on the Pantheon in 1804 with the architect and restorer Giuseppe Valadier (1762-1832). In 1809 he concluded his tenure at the Capitoline with the Napoleonic occupation, but continued work with Valadier on the Domus Aurea and the Temple of Vesta. The excavation in 1812 of the arena in the Colosseum set off a major debate with many of his colleagues. After the Napoleonic withdrawal in 1814, Fèa continued his archaeolgical research. He correctly identified the Temple of Castor in 1816 with the Duc de Blacas (Pierre-Louis-Jean-Casimir Duc de Blacas d'Aulps, 1770-1839). The following year he discovered the Clivus Capitolinus and the Temple of Concord with the count of Funchal. His 1819 guide to the antiquities of Rome, Nouva descrizione de' monumenti antichi, remains an important study of the time. His work on Etruscan vases, Storia dei vasi fittili, appeared in 1832.

"Ghiberti, Lorenzo","Ghiberti, Lorenzo","","1378","1455","Florence, Italy","Florence, Italy","Italy","male","","","Sculptor and architect; his Book II of his memoirs forms an important account of 14th-century artists. Ghibert's parents were Cione Paltami Ghiberti (d. 1406), somewhat of a n'er-do-well, and Mona Fiore. Shortly after his birth his mother left Cione to live with the goldsmith Bartolo di Michele (d 1422), known as Bartoluccio, marring him after Cione's death. Ghiberti learned goldsmithing from Bartoluccio. He left Florence in 1400 along with another artist to serve the ruling Malatesta of Pesaro. Learning of a competition for the design of bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery he returned to the city, winning the commission. Bartoluccio also collaborated bronze doors (today the north doors) of the Baptistery in Florence. He was elevated to the rank of master in the goldsmith's guild in 1409. At the end of his life, Ghiberti wrote his memoirs, I commentarii, a work in three sections (or books) begun around 1447 and never completed. The first book theoretical, an assessment of classical art, quoting from the writings of Vitruvius and Pliny the Elder. Because Ghiberti was a sculptor, he understandibly praised ancient art (mostly sculpture) and the necessity of the artist to know both the liberal arts and theoretical sciences. Like Pliny before him, Ghiberti saw ancient sculputre's strength in its naturalism. He supplemented this, again from Pliny, with a long discourse on classical bronze statuary and clay modelling. Book 2 is an art history, begining with Giotto's resurrection of art from its moribund state in the middle ages. To Ghiberti, Giotto ""abandoned the crudeness of the Greeks and rose to be the most excellent painter in Etruria."" Ghiberti continued with a history of painting and sculpture in Florence and Siena the 13th and 14th centuries. He largely confined himself in these histories to style rather than the anecdotal treatment other art narratives did. The history ends with an account of his own life, the earliest autobiography of an artist, largely a list in chronology of his works. The work ends with Book 3, a discussion of the knowledge (""sciences"") necessary for a sculptor: optics, anatomy, and human proportion. Ghiberti's I commentarii is unique among 15th-century writings on art in its goal as a developmental art history from antiquity to his own time. Ghiberti was the first to insist upon the humanistic belief that ancient art was unequaled. He praised Sienese painters, Ambrogio Lorenzetti in particular, whose naturalistic settings Ghiberti felt his own art was indebted. Ghiberti as an art historian interested two of the top art historians of the twentieth century, Julius Alwin von Schlosser and Richard Krautheimer.","English [second book], Fengler, Christie Knapp, trans.

"Ginzburg, Carlo","Ginzburg, Carlo","","1939","","Turin, Italy","","Italy","male","","","UCLA historian who made important contributions to art history. Ginzburg was born to Leone Ginzburg (1909-1944) and Natalia Levi (Ginzburg) (1916-1991). His father was a professor of Russian co-founder the publishing firm Einaudi; his mother became one of Italy's leading writers. During World War II, his father's anti-Fascist stance resulted in police harassment and a forced relocation from their home in Turin to a village in the Abruzzi. After the fall of Mussolini in 1943, his father, a Jew, was arrested by the Nazis, who had taken over Italy, for publishing an underground newspaper. He was beaten to death by the Gestapo in 1944. Carlo was hidden by his only non-Jewish relative under the name Carlo Tanzi. After the war, his mother married Gabriele Baldini (1919-1969) in 1950, a professor of English literature. Ginzburg attended one of Italy's most prestigious secondary schools, the Scuola Normal Superiore in Pisa before entering the University of Pisa where he received a Doctor of Letters in 1961. He was appointed assistant in modern Italian history at the University of Rome. Ginzburg visited the Warburg Institute, London as a fellow in 1964. In 1966 he emerged as an innovative historian with his book, I benandanti, (translated into English initially as an article in a collection of essays in 1969 and later as the book Night Battles), a book documenting witches as practitioners of an ancient fertility religion in the sixteenth century. The publication of the practice of the benandanti, or ""good walkers"" set Ginzburg up as a major innovative cultural historian. In 1970 he moved to the University of Bologna as professor of modern history, but by 1973 was in the United States as a visiting professor at Princeton University. He followed this with a visiting fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1975, the first of two times. In 1979 Ginzberg and the art historian Enrico Castelnuovo published a discussion of ""center and periphery"" in the history of Italian art. A Yale University visiting fellowship followed in 1983 before his second Institute for Advanced Study fellowship in 1986. He was appointed Franklin D. Murphy Professor of Italian Renaissance Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1988. He was awarded a Getty Center visiting fellowship and one at the école Pratique des Hautes études, Paris. In 1992 he was awarded the Aby M. Warburg Prize. Between 1996 and 1997 he was a Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, Berlin, followed by an Italian Academy for Advanced Study on America, Columbia University, New York, in 1998. Ginzburg married for a second to Luisa Ciammitti, a curator at the National Museum of Art in Bologna, and a research associate for 18th-century Italian documents in the Getty Center's in Malibu, California.As an historian, Ginzburg researched myths, customs and court records (the Inquisition), to trace a history of common people through, in some cases, the most modest of facts. Together with the historians Robert Darnton and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie the formed a group working on the ""history of mentalities.""

"Cavalcaselle, G.B.","Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle","Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle","1819","1897","Legnago, Italy; [Verona vicinity]","Rome, Italy","Italy","male","renaissance","Accademia di Belle Arti","Artist and art historian; collaborator with Joseph Archer Crowe on the first modern history of art to be written in English. Cavalcaselle studied studio painting at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice. When his interests changed to art history, he moved to Milan and Florence to study renaissance art. In 1847 he met Joseph Archer Crowe, a British art historian in Italy. The following year, Cavalcaselle joined in the 1848 revolutions sweeping Europe. For his part in the Italian revolt, he was condemned to death and force to flee. He settled in London in 1850 working for George Scharf as a illustrator of art. He may also have worked as a restorer. Cavalcaselle's reputation as a connoisseur was already great. Charles Lock Eastlake, then president of the Royal Academy, employed Cavalcaselle and two other eminent art connoisseurs, Gustav Friedrich Waagen and Johann David Passavant that same year to write about pictures for the catalog of the Permanent Gallery of Art in Liverpool. In 1851 Cavalcaselle supported Seymour Stocker Kirkup (1788-1880) in Kirkup's attribution of a portrait of Dante by Giotto in the Bargello fresco of Paradise in Florence. The following year, Cavalcaselle was asked by Crowe, with whom he shared living quarters in London, to help with Crowe's book on fifteenth-century Flemish painters. This resulted in their famous collaboration and the earliest work in English of serious art scholarship, A History of Painting in Italy from the Second to the Sixteenth Century (1853). Cavalcaselle traveled throughout Europe, making the acquaintance of the art historian and dealer Otto Mündler in Paris, who was acquiring art for the National Gallery, London. Cavalcaselle made attributions for the Manchester Art Treasures exhibition catalog of 1857. In 1857, too, Cavalcaselle began research for an English-language edition of the masterwork by Giorgio Vasari, Most Excellent Painters, commissioned by Eastlake, the publisher John Murray, the amateur archaeologist Austen Henry Layard (1817 -1894) and the playwright Tom Taylor (1817-1880). His job was twofold: to examine the extant paintings mentioned in the Vite and compare Varsari's claims with the documents in Italian archives. He worked until 1861 on the Vasari project, building on the research of Pietro Giordani (1774-1848) and Giuseppe B. Campori. Cavalcaselle soon developed an expertise in Italian art as he had for Flemish. Eastlake sent him on several buy trips for the National Gallery, one in 1858 which Eastlake accompanied him another the following year to evaluate a Roman sale. Cavalcaselle eventually abandoned the Vasari project for a new one with Crowe, a history of Italian painting. The ouster of religious authority in Italy by the new, unified Italian government allowed him to return, where he received a commission to inventory church holdings in the Marches and Umbria in 1861, together with the connoisseur and collector Giovanni Morelli. Cavalcasell became alarmed that the new Italian government was losing precious art through neglect and over-restoration. In 1862 to exhorted the government to establish an office within the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione to control Italy's art treasures. Though the proposal went unheeded, Cavalcaselle continued to work toward this end. His trips to France and Austria in 1863, the German states in 1863-1865, and elsewhere expanded his knowledge an expertise. Crowe's and Cavalcaselle's New History of Painting in Italy appeared from Murray beginning in 1864 and soon after in a German edition, edited by Anton Springer. The groundbreaking work recast much of art history based upon their chronologies of the artist's individual development. Two subsequent volumes, treating the north Italian schools, appeared in 1871. In 1867, Cavalcaselle was named Inspector for the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, in Florence. He continued to consult for the National Gallery, now under the direction of William Boxall, until 1869. He moved to Rome in 1875 to accept a minister-level position as Inspector General of Painting and Sculpture. As Ministerio, he oversaw the art restoration, including of the paintings in S Francesco, Assisi, advised on museum acquisition and structure. He was instrumental in the laws prohibiting exports of art, and set the government standards for restoration of paintings and mosaics. Impressed with his organizational talents and authority, he and Crowe were called to Austria to reorganize the Belvedere Gallery in 1873. In 1877, he and Crowe issued a biography, Titian: His Life and Times which was meant to cap the History of Painting in North Italy volumes. Between 1882-1885 the two also issued Raphael: His Life and Works. Cavalcaselle retired from the Ministero in1893, issuing a much enlarged Italian-language edition of A History of Painting in Italy, 1886-1908. The collaboration between Crowe and Cavalcaselle was one of the great teams of art history. The two traveled together, Cavalcaselle making notes on the pictures, and detailed drawings. Crowe appears to have written the text entirely himself, with much input on attribution by Cavalcaselle, although the true division of work has never been established.

Cavalcaselle's connoisseur's sensitivity to the pictorial language of art history is documented in his drawings. He was adept at establishing on formal basis, the various periods within an artist's oeuvre. Crowe's autobiography (1895) discusses Cavalcaselle's method in detail. A New History of Painting in Italy was the first serious study to cast personal experience of a large amount of art into a conceptual framework. The numerous new attributions and chronologies set their works as classics for nascent discipline of art history. Adolfo Venturi called Cavalcaselle a ""second Vasari"" and the most complete italian art history since Luigi Antonio Lanzi.","[all the following written in conjunction with: Crowe, Joseph Archer.]  The Early Flemish Painters: Notices of their Lives and Works.

After graduating in civil engineering from the University of Rome in 1895, Giovannoni took a degree in public health before studying art and architectural history in Rome under Adolfo Venturi. In 1899 he was appointed assistant under Guglielmo Calderini (1837-1916) in the Engineering School and in 1905 professor of general architecture. A strong technical as well as art-historical interest took him into the conservation field and projects for urban redevelopment. In 1910 he became president of the Associazione Artistica tra i Cultori dell' Architettura (AACA), founded in Rome in 1890 with the aim of extending the awareness of the historic and artistic heritage and to promote conservation initiatives. This aspect of his career is reflected in such early schemes as that for the Caprera quarter of Rome (1907-1911), which overlapped with his work for the Peroni brewery, a factory (1909) and a company headquarters (1913), putting into practice his belief in the architetto integrale, able to encompass both artistic and technical skills. In 1911 Giovannoni was a member of the staff for the creation of the ethnographic pavilions of the Exhibition in Rome. In 1913 Giovannoni published his most important essay ""Città vecchia ed edilizia nuova"" where underlining the diversity of the historical city centre that for structural and social reasons cannot effectively comfort to the modern city. Giovannoni was interested in valorizing national patrimony as the key component to the industry of tourism. His research interests focused on the work of the Italian Renaissance architect Antonio da Sangallo, who himself combined careful archaeological knowledge with architectural skills. This Renaissance concept of the architect inspired Giovannoni's approach to architectural pedagogy. In 1918, through the AACA, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Scuola Superiore di Architettura and eventually the new Istituto Universitaria where he lectured in the restoration of historic monuments. In 1921 Giovannoni became the editor with the architect Marcello Piacentini (1881-1960) of the journal Architettura e Arti, the official organ of the Associazione artistica fra i cultori di architettura. In the same year Giovannoni with Piacentini and the architect Vittorio Ballio Morpugno curated the ""Mostra d'arte rustica"". Giovannoni summed up the operative aims of the exhibition in some letters to the Trieste-based architect Camillo Jona (1886-1974). Giovannoni was appointed Dean of the Scuola Superiore di Architettura from 1931 to 1935. He and Venturi wrote an important text on the theory of architecture, Sul metodo della storia dell'architettura, in 1938. He died at the age of 74 in Rome, 15 July 1947. His students at the University of Rome included Roberto Pane. Giovannoni's colleagues included the American archaeologist William H. Goodyear. His scholarship influenced the art historian Mario Salmi and the art historian Federico Hermanin (1871-1953), a member of the Amministrazione delle Belle Arti of Rome Guglielmo De Angelis D'Ossat, dedicated obituaries and essays in his memory. Giovannoni wrote numerous articles and books in which discussed themes ranging from urbanism to art history, especially art connected with architecture. He wrote essays in Italian art journals including Palladio, (of which he was also an editorial board member), and Annali d'ingegneria e d'architettura, Bollettino d'arte del Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione, L'Arte Rassegna d'arte antica e moderna.

Giotto scholar. In Bologna, Gnudi sponsored many exhibitions with Denis Mahon, bringing Italian Baroque artists to a higher profile. Historian of Italian art, particularly Bolognese art, curator and medieval and modern art professor at University of Bologna. Gnudi attended the University of Bologna completing his studies with a thesis on the XVth century Italian sculptor Niccolò dell'Arca (Bari 1435 - Bologna, 1494). In 1940s he was a member of the Amministrazione delle Belle Arti in Bologna, in 1952 he was subsequently Soprintendente ai Beni artistici of Bologna. During his tenure, he supervised restorations, organized exhibitions and produced art-historical studies of considerable interest. In particular he played a leading role in organizing the series of splendid exhibitions which have proved such a feature of culture life in Bologna (e.g. in 1954 that of Guido Reni). These included a number of exhibitions of fine arts, organized by Gnudi with his friends and students Francesco Arcangeli and Andrea Emiliani, aimed at a new appraisal of the conspicuous fine-arts tradition that had characterized Bologna and its region since the 17th century. In 1950s he was one of the member of the staff for the reorganization of Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna and in 1956 he became a trustee of the National Gallery. Gnudi's range of interests was wide. In fact, in 1979 his energy was put behind the organization of the Twenty-Fourth International Congress of Art Historians at Bologna. There, despite his great administrative responsibilities, he contributed a characteristically modest and incisive paper to the section on East-West relations in the thirteenth century. Since the 1940s Gnudi's writings revealed his deep links with his beloved Bologna. He devoted an early study to the later sculpture of the marble shrine of Saint Dominic in Bologna Niccolò dell'Arca (Turin 1942). In 1948 he focused his research on the sculptors Arnolfo di Cambio and Giovanni Pisano and he wrote the fundamental book Nicola, Arnolfo, Lapo, (Florence, 1948) where he performed a pioneering feat of connoisseurship, which has in large part resisted the erosions of time and of later criticism. Here he focused on the problem of the original core of the shrine, and attempted to separate the respective role of Nicola Pisano and his assistants. In 1954 he wrote the Great Centuries of Painting (Skira) volume on Gothic art with Jacques Dupont, (1954). In Bologna, Gnudi sponsored many exhibitions with Denis Mahon, bringing Italian Baroque artists to a higher profile. In 1956 to the volume of essays dedicated to Lionello Venturi he contributed a perceptive paper on Simone Martini which remains one of the most important study on the artist (Grandezza di Simone in Scritti di storia dell'arte in onore di Lionello Venturi. Rome 1956). He wrote, also, important studies about Giotto, in particular in 1958 he edited the most substantial monument to his scholarship, that is his large scale monograph on Giotto (Milan 1958). In this book he commented on the fresco cycle of the Legend of Saint Francis in the Upper Church at Assisi and on the early career of the painter. About the same subject he offered a stimulating contribution to the anniversary congress Giotto e il suo tempo in 1967. In 1959 he collaborated with the Samuel Kress Foundation in New York for the important congress and book dedicated to William Suida. In 1962 he focused on the Bolognese XIV painter Vitale da Bologna (Milan 1962), in this book he traced the career of the XIV cent. Bolognese painter. In 1971, at the end of his period as Soprintendente he was able to stage an important exhibition of many acquisitions covering the previous five years, including an early Guercino (hitherto lost) which his eloquent advocacy persuaded the Ministry to buy at auction in Rome. In the same period he became Vice- President (under ministerial presidency) of the Consiglio Nazionale per I Beni Culturali e Ambientali. He wrote reviews in Italian art journals including Arte Veneta, Paragone Arte, Commentari, Bollettino d'arte, Critica d'arte and international journals e.g. The Burlington Magazine and Revue de l'Art. He wrote numerous articles and books in which discussed themes ranging from medieval and modern artists (e.g. Pittura bolognese del '300, 1978; L'arte gotica in Francia e in Italia, 1982) to various contemporary painters (e.g. Mario Negri) especially those of Bolognese territory. He died unexpectedly at the age of 71 while working on three important studies: the essay Il ruolo dell'Italia nel Duecento, (Bologna 1982)for C.I.H.A. Comité International d' Histoire de l'Art proceedings edited by Hans Belting and the books L'ideale classico : saggi sulla tradizione classica nella pittura del Cinquecento e del Seicento (Bologna 1981) and L'arte gotica in Francia e in Italia (Torin 1982). At his death a portion of his library was donated to the research library at Palazzo Ghisilardi Fava in Bologna. The ""Gnudi"" collection is currently under arrangement but gathers a rich collection of photos mainly depicting medieval and post medieval artworks. In 1980s it was created also a Foundation dedicated to Gnudi (materials are also there), unfortunately it is now closed. His rich art collection (with Morandi, XVII cent. Bolognese artists, etc.) was donated to the National modern art Gallery of his city. Gnudi's scholarship influenced the art historians and friends Francesco Arcangeli, Andrea Emiliani, Denis Mahon, Cesare Brandi, Francesco Riccomini and Paolo Fossati who dedicated to him obituaries and essays. He was friends of artists as for example the photographer Gianni Pezzani, the writer Giorgio Bassani, the architect Leone Pancaldi. His friend the art collector Denis Mahon reports Gnudi was an unique combination of inspiration, drive, practical common sense and invincible good humor.","Niccolò dell'Arca, Turin: Einaudi, 1942.

He studied under Anton Maria Salvini (1653-1729) and was inspired by the Etruscan studies of Filippo Buonarroti (1661-1733). Gori was appointed a professor of history at the Liceo of Florence. An early work on classical inscriptions, Inscriptiones graecae et latinae, appeared in 1727. It was about this time, too, that he developed an interest in Renaissance art history. Gori produced his survey of the classical collections of Italy, the Museum florentinum beginning in 1731. Eventually completed after his death, it reached twelve volumes and was completed in 1763. Although the series embraced all media (gems, sculpture, coins, etc.), many of which had not previously been published, the work was uncritical, publishing poor quality examples and some forgeries. Gori founded the Societé Colombaria in 1735 in Florence, a companion society to Accademia Etrusca of Cortona. In 1736, Gori's Museum etruscum began to appear (through 1743), a three-volume work on Etrscan objects. The popularity of Gori's book and conclusions angered the other publishing Etruscanist of the time, Fancesco Scipione Maffei (1675-1755). Their quarrels seemed personal as well as professional, with Maffei criticizing Gori's knowledge of the Etruscan alphabet and Gori accusing Maffei of plagiarism. Together with Stefano Evodio Assemani (1707-1782) he published various manuscripts in the Laurentia Library in 1743. He became provost of the Baptistery of San Giovanni in 1746. His Museum cortonense covered the antiquities of Cortona. The Museum florentinum was published over a thirty-five year period in four overall distinct parts, 1) antique cameos and portraits (Gemmae antiquae ex Thesauro Mediceo et privatorum dactyliothecis florentiae. Imagines virorum illustrium et deorum). 1731-1732, [2 volumes], 2) antique statues and monuments (Statuae antiquae dorum et virorum illustrium. 1734. [1 volume], 3) gold and silver coins (Antiqua numismata aurea et argentea. 1740-1740-1742. [3 volumes], 4) biographies of artists, architects, sculptors and engravers (Serie di ritratti degli eccellenti pittori 1752-1766. [6 volumes]. His methodoloy was influential in the establishment of f Archaeology. His works he presented to a wider audience information about objects that had previously been seen by only a privileged few. His publications of ancient sculpture and antiquities formed the repertory on which 18th-century scholarship as well as neoclassicism were later based. His work is listed in the bibliography of Leopoldo Conte Cicognara as 3417.

Guicciardini was the son of Jacopo Guicciardini (d. 1552) and Camilla d'Agnolo des Bardi (d. 1557). His uncle was the historian Francesco Guicciardini (1483-1540). He was well educated according to the affluent means of his family including learning Latin and some Greek. He moved to Antwerp by 1542 where he remainded his whole life. In 1567, after publishing some minor works, collections of anecdotes and maximes, etc., he published Descrittione di m. Lodouico Guicciardini patritio fiorentino, di tutti i Paesi Bassi, a geopolitical description of the area which included a significant discussion of artists. The work is a major source of information on the artists of the period. A French edition appeared the same year. The same year, Guicciardini suffered the first of a series of political incarcerations, imprisoned and his home confiscated for criticism of the ruling Duque de Alba, Governor of the Netherlands. In 1569 he was denounced for alleged dealings with Protestants and again imprisoned, this time in Brussels. In 1582 he was arrested in connection with a plot to assasinate William the Silent, Prince of Orange and in 1588 arrested again during the last years of the war against the Protestants. He was released because of his age. A third and final edition of Descrittione was printed by Plantin the same year. Guicciardini was pensioned his final years (50 livres d'artois) from Antwerp. He died at 68 and is buried in the Antwerp Cathedral. An English edition of the Descrittione appeared in 1593. The artistic biographical section of the Descrittione is an amalgam of personal experience, the input of artists (Lucas de Heere and Dominicus Lampsonius) and portions of the first edition of the Vite (1550) by Giorgio Vasari. Guicciardini adopts Vasari's assertion that Jan van Eyck discovered oil painting and reference to the (presumed) Portinari Altarpiece of Hugo van der Goes. Vasari clearly read Guicciardini's work for in his second edtion of the Vite, 1568, Vasari includes Jan's brother, Hubert van Eyck, mentioned in Guicciardini's work.

Nicolò La Corte and Pontrelli, music teacher, and by Mrs. Maria Cailler and Pagliano. As a boy he was inclined to the study of history and in particular that of our city, to which he dedicated himself, fighting to the last, for the preservation of the surviving artistic heritage of Messina after the catastrophe of 1908. This is the evocative atmosphere in which we enter, with the incredibly similar grandson of the same name, Gaetano La Corte, with whom I shared the same courtyard as children. «As a boy he lived with his parents in the Cicala houses. Grandpa Gaetano slept downstairs, and his father, great-grandfather Nicolò, a musician by profession, on the upper floor. Late at night he resumed his way home, tired and tried after hours dedicated to his concerts. All awake, awaiting his return, knew by now the moves and the rituals that concluded the nights. And even grandfather remained awake and listened to his footsteps that resounded through the house, until he heard the thud of the first shoe coming from the ceiling, a sign of imminent surrender to sleep. But it was only after the thud of the ""second shoe"", finally, it was certainty for everyone that the moment of deserved rest had come "". ""...so as to have a pencil and a notepad, he willingly gave up his sandwich..."" continues his nephew in a voice broken by emotion. ""...and wishing that the people of Messina could draw on the same book sources very dear to him, after the earthquake that almost entirely destroyed the libraries of the city, he loaded all his books on an ox cart and took them personally to the University of Messina"". In fact, there is the ""La Corte Cailler Fund"" at the Regional University Library. The genuineness and generosity of spirit is a clear prerogative of the La Corte family, and in particular of La Corte Cailler who always did his best for his beloved Messina. ""...he took notes on everything, with meticulousness and hard work!""...concludes his nephew. In fact his diaries bear witness to this. Messina was orphaned by the great historian Gaetano La Corte Cailler, on 26 January 1933.","","Messinaweb.eu https://www.messinaweb.eu/cultura/personaggi-illustri-di-ieri/item/449-gaetano-la-corte-cailler.html

Lanciani hailed from ancient noble family. His father, Pietro Lanciani, was an engineer and his brother-in-law, Comte Virginio Vespignani (1808-1882) was an architect and draftsman for archeological books. After attending the (Jesuit) Collegio Romano and a period training as an engineer at the University of Rome, he joined an excavating project around Trajan's harbor, in the ancient city of Ostia (Lazio), at the mouth of the Tiber River. The event changed his life forever. After publishing an exemplary description of the site in the Monumenti and Annali of the Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica beginning in 1867, Lanciani became absorbed in the archaeological study of monuments taking a degree in Literature (focusing on Greek and Latin). In 1872 Lanciani was appointed secretary of the Commissione Archaeologica Communale (municipal archaeological commission). He married an American translator, Mary Ellen ""Elana"" Rhodes (d. 1917), of Providence, R. I., in 1875, which gave him entre into scientific and academic circles among U.S. archaeologists. Lanciani was appointed vice-director of the Museo Kircheriano in 1876. By 1878 he had been named director of excavations for the city of Rome and professor of Roman topography at the University of Rome; he remained at the University until two years before his death. He rose to chair of Roman topography in 1882. Lanciani assisted museum acquistion of antiquities, such as the Boston Museum of Arts’ purchase of over 300 ancient objects from Italy. In 1893 he issued the first sheet of perhaps his most important publication, Forma Urbis Romae. An intricate map of the ancient city with modern streets overlaid. As one of the few Italian professors to speak fluently English, he edited, together with important British art historians Austen Henry Layard the 15th edition of the original 1843 A Handbook of Rome and its Environs, a guidebook to Rome for John Murray publishers in 1894.  Despite his success as both an archaeologist and scholar, the newly unified Italian government dismissed him from the archaeological service for improprieties in 1890. These included accusations of aiding looters of archaeological sites and misidentifying the archaeological record. These charges reveal the tensions between the city of Rome and the Italian state on the conservation, preservation and displaying the nation’s antiquities (Dixon). He was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei and the Academia di S. Lucia. He composed several works in English for that readership, his most important in the language, The Ruins & Excavations of Ancient Rome: a Companion Book for Students and Travelers appeared in 1897. By the end of the century, Lanciani was responsible for and supervising all the excavations within the city. He carried out a number of excavations making, most notably, the discovery of the House of Vestals in the Roman Forum. In addition, Lanciani produced maps of this work. His Storia degli scavi di Roma, in four volumes, is a collection of all information available about excavation and discoveries in the city to 1605. He continued to write first-hand descriptions of current archaeological discoveries, and he built a sizable collection of excerpts from Renaissance records and from the albums of Renaissance artists, the archaeological significance of which Lanciani was among the first to recognize. Other English-language works followed as well, including Wanderings in the Roman Campagna, which he published in 1909. At the retirement of Giacomo Boni in 1910 from the Commission of the Zona Monumentale, Lanciani replaced him. In that capacity, he helped prevent the implementation of a city park at the cite of the Baths of Caracalla. Poor health forced him to curtail his writing in 1912. He received numerous honorary degrees, including those from Aberdeen, Würzburg, Oxford, Harvard, and Glasgow. After his first wife succumbed to the influenza epidemic in Europe in 1917, Lanciani remarried a second time in 1920 to the widow of Prince Marco Antonio Colonna, Princess Teresa Caracciolo Colonna. He died in Rome in 1929. Much of this material has been preserved through Lanciani's own donation of his schedario, or series of portfolios, to the Vatican Library, and through his heirs' gift of his books, prints, plans, and manuscripts to the Istituto Italiano di Archeologia e Belle Arti. His students at the University of Rome included the archeologist Giulio Quirino Giglioli.Lanciani was a pioneer of a rational, modern approach to Roman cartography and archaeology. He formed part of a core of distinguished late nineteenth-century scholars of the Roman forum who included Thomas Ashby, Heinrich Jordan (1833-1886), Christian Huelsen, and Samuel B. Platner (1863-1921). In 1967, Richard Brilliant described Lanciani's Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome as undiminished in vitality as a study of ancient Roman ruins. His Forma Urbis Romae was ""a magnificent map of the city and a marvellous example of cartography as well as an encyclopaedia of typographical information. It is still an essential tool for anyone working on the ancient city"" (Richardson). City maps of the twenty-first century typically have a scale of 1:20,000 (five cm on the map equivalent to one km on the ground). The forty-six maps of the Forma Urbis have a scale of 1:1,000. The work is still unsurpassed to this day. Many of his English-language books on Rome were subsequently translated into Italian.","Guida del Palatino. Con pianta delineata da Alessandro Zangolini.

Lanzi was educated as a Jesuit priest at Fermo and Rome, joining the Order of St. Ignatius. He taught classics at various schools and came under the classicizing spell of Anton Mengs and the art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, both of whose work appeared at that time. Lanzi survived the suppression of the Jesuit order in 1773 having been in Siena for health reasons, to be appointed by Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany (1747-1792) to the office of antiquities assistant at the galleries in Florence in 1775. The following year he was appointed curator of the museum, where he published Guida alla Galleria di Firenze, a guide to the newly reorganized collections in 1782. During these years Lanzi had also studied archaeological sites, particularly the little-known Etruscan finds. After nearly five years in Rome preparing his work, Lanzi published his Saggio di lingua etrusca e di altre antiche d'Italia in 1789, a summary catalog on Etruscan life and art. The book formed a comprehensive collection of the Etruscan language and customs. But his assertion that Etruscan language derived from Hebrew was strongly criticized and never gained acceptance. Lanzi continued to study Italian art as a private scholar. In 1790 the Grand Duke recalled him to Florence to resume his antiquarian work. However, Lanzi spent much of the following years traveling and taking notes for his next project, a history of Italian painting. His monumental Storia pittorica dell'Italia appeared between 1795 and 1796. The Storia was the first treatment of the history of Italian art viewed as a succession of stylistic developments rather than fit into the biographies of the artists. It begins with a bold refutation of the claim of Giorgio Vasari that painting had been ""altogether lost"" before Cimabue. Lanzi had met and exchanged ideas with many of the important scholars of the time, including Bartolomeo Gamba (1770-1841), Mauro Boni (1746-1817), and the collector/art historians Pietro Brandolese (1754-1809) and Giovanni de Lazara (1744-1833) as well as the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen. In 1806 Lanzi's work on the so-called Etruscan vases appeared, correctly identifying their Greek origin, and refuting many errors current with the mania of things Etruscan at the time. His findings were convincingly confirmed by Eduard Gerhard in 1831. Lanzi put together a collection of Etruscan antiquities which now forms the Archaeological Museum in Florence. In 1809 his second edition of the Storia appeared, which is considered his masterpiece. He is buried in Florence at Santa Croce next to Michelangelo. Lanzi employed connoisseurship and a systemization derived from his classification of sculpture as a means to distinguish and organize art into a coherent vision. He saw the artist as an independent creator, defining the styles and manner of artists and epochs with the artist and less of their time. His rigorous scientific method to the study objects and languages fit the Enlightenment age of which he was a part. His revisionist view of Vasari was supported by the work of Karl Friedrich von Rumohr in his Italienische Forschungen, 1827-1831. The philologist Wilhelm Corssen (1820-1875) called Lanzi ""the father of ancient Italian studies."" Rudolf Wittkower, in the introduction to his Art and Architecture in Italy, termed Lanzi's work as ""still unequaled."" His work inspired the Berlin school of art historians, Rumohr and especially Waagen.","Storia Pittorica della Italia dal risorgimento delle belle arti fin presso al fin del XVIII secolo. 3 vols.

During this time he came into contact with the famous doctor and autobiographer Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) and the heir to and owner of Leonardo's notebooks, Francesco Melzi. After becoming an independent master, he received a steady stream of commissions for murals and altarpieces, many the auspices of Giuliano Goselini (1525-1587), a secretary to successive dukes of Milan. Lomazzo made a tour in 1562 to various countries, studying art. In 1568 he became ""Prince"" ('Abbot' or 'Nabad') of the Accademia della Balle del Blenio. By 1571, however, Lomazzo had become completely blind and he turned to art writing. His most important work for scholars today, Trattato della pittura, was published in 1584. An autobiography, Rime, appeared in1589. The following year, 1590, Idea del tempio della pittura was issued. This book, organized around the concept of a temple whose architectural components signify the seven parts of painting, included artists' biographies. Thus Lomazzo emerged as a proto-historian of art. His other writing remained in manuscript. His most famous pupil, Figino, was the subject of a 1592 dialogue-style work by Canon Antonio Comanini (d. 1608).Lomazzo is studied by art historians today for his metaphysical theories of artistic creation. His discussions rival in complexity of those from any period. His Trattato, a seven-book (or part) neo-Platonic work shows the influence by the thinking of Marcello Ficino. A conspicuous figure in artistic and intellectual circles in northern Italy, Lomazzo's contemporary reputation was as much as a painter as theorist, reaching beyond his native Milan. His treatises were not reprinted for several hundred years, though translations, such an English one by Richard Haydocke of parts of the Trattato was published in 1598; a French translation in 1649. In the 20th century, the art historians Erwin Panofsky, Gerald M. Ackerman, Robert Klein and Roberto Ciardi brought his writings back to light and works to a new audience.","Trattato dell'arte de la pittura.

"Longhi, Roberto","Longhi, Roberto","Roberto Longhi","1890","1970","Alba, Cuneo, Italy","Florence, Italy","Italy","male","","","Art historian, critic and magazine founder; Piero della Francesca scholar. Longhi's parents were originally from Emilia. Longhi wrote his dissertation on Caravaggio under Pietro Toesca in Turin, 1911. He supported himself by teaching art history in the licei (high schools) of Rome while attending the School of Advanced Studies (in Rome) under Adolfo Venturi. Venturi, impressed with Longhi's intellect, assigned him the book reviews section of Venturi's magazine, L'Arte, in 1914. He also contributed to L'Arte and La Voce between 1913-1920. Longhi's two life-long art subjects were Caravaggio and Piero della Francesca. Piero was still a relatively obscure artist when Longhi published a 1914 article on him, ""Piero dei Franceschi e lo sviluppo della pittura veneziana,"" (Piero Francesca and the Development of Venetian Painting). The publisher Mario Broglio (1891-1948), who founded the journal Valori Plastici in 1918, asked Longhi to write a full-length monograph on the artist. Although a Renaissance historian, Longhi also took a keen interest in modern art, championing the Futurists and especially Umberto Baccioni but disparaging the Pittura Metafisica movement. Around the 1920, he became part of the circle of the collector and art dealer Count Alessandro Contini Bonacossi (1878-1955), who funded Longhi's travels and helped launch his career as a connoisseur. In 1924 he married the writer Lucia Lopresti (1895 -1985), who wrote under the pen name ""Anna Banti."" In 1927 Broglio brought out Longhi's masterwork, Piero della Francesca, establishing Piero as one of the great Quattrocento artists. This was in contrast to the opinion of Bernard Berenson whose 1897 Central Italian Painters of the Renaissance considered Piero ""unemotional"" and ""impassive."" Longhi began writing for other magazines during this time, including Pinacotheca (1927-1929) and, as co-editor with Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli, in Critica d'arte. Another of Longhi's fascinations was Caravaggio and the Caravaggisti. His ""Quesiti caravaggeschi,"" a series of articles, were published between 1928-1934. Longhi's advocacy of connoisseurship put him at odds with Lionello Venturi, Adolfo's son and also an art historian, and the two participated in a celebrated debate, most clearly elaborated in his 1934 book on the painting of Ferrara, Officina ferrarese. The same year, 1934, Longhi was appointed to the chair of art history at the University of Bologna. He acquired the Florentine villa, ""Il Tasso,"" in 1939 which became his home. During the height of World War II, Longhi issued a second edition of his Piero book, 1942, and founded the journal Proporzioni in 1943, the latter offering revisionist interpretations to Tuscan art and particularly Giotto's painting. A second series of articles on Caravaggio appeared as the Ultimi studi caravaggeschi also in 1943. After the war, Longhi was appointed to the chair of art history at the university in Florence in 1949. His wide interest in all the arts led to his launching another journal, Paragone, in 1950, which alternated issues between art and literature. Longhi wrote the introduction to the catalog of the important Caravaggio exhibition of Milan in 1951. A third edition of the Piero book appeared in 1962 and a full-length monograph on Caravaggio (criticized for its lack of footnotes) was published in 1968. Longhi died at his villa in 1970. The Fondazione Roberto Longhi was founded the following year to encourage art-historical scholarship. Longhi's students included the art historian Giovanni Previtali and Luciano Bellosi. Outside the field of art history, the poet Attilio Bertolucci (1911-2000) and the film director Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975) also studied under him.

Longhi remained an influential teacher. His students included detractors as well as admirers. Though he admired Longhi's writing style, Federico Zeri, the controversial historian of art, in later years accused Longhi of authenticating fakes to pay gambling debts. Other students remained more generous. Longhi was philosophically influenced by the esthetics of Benedetto Croce. He added as early as 1912 a more humane, if slightly romantic counter to the positivism of Giovanni Morelli, insisting his connoisseurship was merely ""intuition."" Longhi's methodology was highly formalist and connoisseurship-based, striving to find verbal equivalents for his perceptions of works of art and notions of ""pure painting"" (Agosti). He was more of an advocate of connoisseurship than of a history of art. Charles Hope characterized Longhi as ""a brilliantly eloquent critic and connoisseur, mainly preoccupied with the intense scrutiny of individual works of art,"" adding that Longhi lacked the inclination to investigate social and historical circumstances in which art was produced. Longhi was not insensitive to the criteria, however; the patronage art historian Francis Haskell remarked that what he admired most about Longhi was ""his ability to make historical connections.""","[complete works:] Edizione delle opere complete di Roberto Longhi. 14 vols.

Banti was born Lucia Lopresti. Her father, a lawyer for the railways, Luigi-Vincenzo, was an avid literature enthusiast and her mother was Gemma Benin, both of them of Calabrian background. She attended the Liceo Tasso di Roma (a lyceum or high school), where in 1914 she encountered the young art historian (and future husband) Roberto Longhi. She continued to study art history at the University in Rome under the eminent Adolfo Venturi, who had also been Longhi's mentor. Venturi supervised her thesis on the seventeenth-century artist and dealer Marco Boschini (1602–1681). A subsequent 1919 essay by her on Boschini in Venturi's own publication, L'Arte, was noted favorably the the art philosopher Benedetto Croce (1856-1952). She married Longhi in 1924. By 1930 she had adopted the pseudonym ""Anna Banti"", the name of a beloved relative, to distinguish herself from her husband. Her first article under that name, ""Barbara e la morte"", was expanded into a book in 1937.

One of her husband's students in Bologna where he taught was the young (future film director) Pier Paolo Passolini (1922-1975). Passolini and Banti became close friends. A book by Banti, Itinerario di Paolina, appeared in 1937, During WWII, Banti continued to write novels, clearly propaganda for Fascism and American motives. The most prominent of these, Sette Lune (Seven Moons) was issued in 1941. As the war progressed, Banti transcribed a novel to a screenplay romance film called Sissignora (Yes, Madam) in 1942. The following year Pasolini wrote an evaluative article on her, terming her work ""Mannerist"", meaning her writings focused on re-enactment of painting. While the war still ensued, Banti turned to researching a historical novel about the female baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi. The first draft, however, was destroyed during Allied bombing in 1944 and she was forced to rewrite the manuscript. It was published after the war, 1947, as Artemisa. It became her most important book, popularizing a heretofore obscure painter.

The post-war years saw Banti and her husband founding  Paragone, a journal for art and literature in 1950; her husband was editor. The same year she published her translation of Virginia Woolf's Jacob’s Room which resulted in the popularization of Woolf in Italy. Banti also translated French authors such as Colette. Her most feminist publication were her collected short stories, Le donne muoiono (The Women Die) which appeared in 1951. Banti returned to art history; brief biographies of artists followed, Fra Angelico and) Lorenzo Lotto (both 1953), Diego Velásquez (1955), Claude Monet (1956) as well as others into the 1960s. In addition she maintained a log-running cinema column in the magazine L’approdo letterario. After Longhi's death in 1970, Banti assumed the editorship of Paragone until 1985 when she divided the editorship between art and literature, the former to Mina Gregori (b. 1924).

Banti's Artemisia claims importance because the novel format introduced the then obscure artist to a wide public. Her husband had written a 1916 article on the painter, followed by a brief discussion by Hermann Voss in his Die Malerei Des Barock In Rom of 1924. Like many of Banti's novels it has autobiographical similarities. An early feminist, Banti treated the obscure artist--remembered mostly for the documents of her rape trial--in what would emerge after the 1970s as a watermark for feminist studies. In the novel Gentileschi is nourished by the influential Genoan noblewoman, Pietra Spinola. Writing Artemesia Banti struggled between her identities as art historian and creative writer. Overshadowed as an art historian by husband she came to terms with in her semi-autobiographical novels, the last of which  Un grido lacernate, (A piercing cry, 1981) discussed in semi-fictional form her relationship with Longhi (Pireddu).

Banti championed Pasolini his whole life. She published his personal journal, Il Ferrobedò, which later became the first chapter of his future bestseller Ragazzi di vita (Street Kids) in 1955. He praised her focus on the emancipated women and use of realism along with naturalism. Her husband's teachings led her to have an eye for specific illuminating details and precision of color and the understanding of various art figures and their historical significance.

Malvasia was born to an aristocratic Bolognese family. He gained early fame for his poetry and dabbled in painting as an aristocratic pursuit under Giacinto Campana (b. 1600) and Giacomo Cavedone and the literary academy dei Gelati. After graduating with a law degree, Malvasia went to Rome in 1639 where he further participated in the literary academies (degli Umoristi and dei Fantastici) and meeting Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Ginetti, Cardinal Bernardino Spada (1594-1661) and the artist Alessandro Algardi (1598-1654). From 1647 onward he lectured in Law at the university in Bologna. After publication of an essay related the theological aspects of a painting, Lettera a Monsignor Albergati, 1652, and obtaining a theology degree in 1653, he was appointed a canon in Bologna Cathedral in 1662. Malvasia's appointment took him to the capitals of the Italian states and contacts with the cultural administrators of the land, including Marco Boschini and Nicolas Régnier, and Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici (whom he advised on his collections) and, in 1665, Pierre Cureau de la Chambre, who gained him entré into the French court of Louis XIV and the Académie Royale. During this period, Malvasia collected and researched the artistic life of his native Bologna. This resulted in the 1678 Felsina pittrice, Malvasia's narrative art history of painting in Bologna. Organized through biographies of Bolognese artists, it is the core primary document on Bolognese artists of the Baroque. Conscious of lives-of-artists books such as the 1550 work of Giorgio Vasari and Giovanni Baglione, Malvasia's attempts to place Bolognese art at the fore, attracting Florentine supremacy and highlighting Bolognese innovation. He divided his book into four sections, beginning with the primitives, then Francesco Francia, then the Carracci and, ending with the great baroque artists of Malvasia's generation, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Francesco Albani and Guercino. In 1686 he published Le pitture di Bologna, a ""gallery guide"" for the artists about whom he had spoken in the Felsina. The guide was tremendously popular and was reprinted seven times in the next hundred years. In 1694, his final art commentary, Il Claustro di S Michele in Bosco di Bologna, on the Caracci school artists, appeared. Malvasia's strong argument for Bologna caused controversy. Filippo Baldinucci attacked Malvasia's stance in an Apologia of his Notizie di professori del disegno, as well as the Venetian Marco Boschini (1613-1678), and in 1703, Vincenzo Vittoria (1650-1712) in his Osservazioni sopra il libro della Felsina Pittrice per difesa di Raffaello. Malvasia's methodology concentrated on documents without forcing a single conclusion, as much of the other art historical encomia had previously done. Giovanni Pietro Bellori, who, in his Vite, used historical material to support his classicist position, whereas Malvasia's Felsina Pittrice is more empirical and allows a greater freedom of aesthetic viewpoints. Malvasia's work suffered much in the centuries since its publication. Parts of his work were attacked as forgeries, others decried his idea of eclecticism for the Carracci. Since the 1980s, Malvasia's work has undergone a period of reassessment and the value of his original ideas and scholarship once again valued. Felsina Pittrice remains one of the core primary texts of the Bolognese Baroque.","[complete bibliography:] Sorbelli, Albano. Inventari dei manoscritti delle biblioteche d'Italia. Florence: L. S.

Manetti was born to a wealthy family of Florentine merchants and educated privately; he retained partial interest in a silk warehouse in Florence throughout his life. Through his studies, he knew the architect and Renaissance theorist Filippo Brunelleschi and became interested in architecture. A true Renaissance man, he was a mathematician, astronomer and friend of the great renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499). Manetti developed as an authority in architecture and may have even designed buildings, but owning to the popularity of his name in Florence, none can be ascribed to him with certainty. In 1466 he was appointed operaio (Councilor) at the Ospedale degli Innocenti, a Brunelleschi designed building of 1419. Around 1480 Manetti appended his account of a life of Brunelleschi, Vita di Filippo Brunelleschi meant to accompany an earlier anecdotal text possibly by Brunelleschi himself, known as Novella del Grasso. The manuscript ends abruptly at the design for Santo Spirito, either because the latter portion was destroyed or it is unfinished. In 1491 Manetti, working under the title of architectus, was part of a panel to select the façade design for the Cathedral in Florence. During that same time, he wrote a second manuscript, Huomini singhularii in Firenze dal MCCCC. innanzi, a more strictly biographical work. Huomini begins with an Italian translation from the second section of the Latin De origine civitatis Florentiae et de eiusdem famosis civibus by Filippo Villani, and concludes with biographies of theologians and other humanists as well as eight Florentine artists, centered around the person of Brunelleschi. Manetti's Vite di Filippo Brunelleschi is the first comprehensive biography of a single Italian artist to be written in the early Renaissance (Pacciani). It was the model for the later Vite of Giorgio Vasari. Manetti's conception of a history of architecture used the familiar standard model of a Greek acme and Roman decline as a segue to Brunelleschi's Renaissance (""rebirthing"") work. Manetti's use of first-hand experiences and excerpts of public documents make his art writing a serious art history as opposed to the anecdotes of famous lives popular at the time. His documentation of Brunelleschi's influence and that of contemporary Florentine culture, illustrates Brunelleschi's intentional introduction of classical architectural motives into the new Renaissance style. Along with Filarete and later Vasari, Manetti conceived of Renaissance architecture as the civilized rebirth from the barbarian Gothic style (Grodecki). Manetti should not be confused with Antonio di Ciaccheri Manetti (1402-1460), also an architect associated with Brunelleschi works.","Vite di Filippo Brunellesch. (Florence, Bib. N. Cent., MS.

"Sarfatti, Margherita","Margherita Sarfatti","Margherita Grassini","1886","1961","Venice, Italy","Cavallasca, Italy","Italy","female","Futurism","","Art-critic and art historian, exponent of the early Italian Futurists and unofficial cultural arbiter during the early years of Italian Fascism.  Sarfatti was born Margherita Grassini. Her father was a government lawyer and businessman, Amedeo Grassini (1848-1908), and he mother Emma Levi (Grassini) (1850-1900). The young Sarfatti was privately (and secularly) tutored at home; one tutor the secretary-general of the newly founded Venice Biennale, Antonio Fradeletto (1858-1930). It was Fradeletto who introduced her to a socialism that would last her lifetime, through the writings of John Ruskin.  Through her father’s illustrious circle of friends--the Venetian state was some of the most respecting of Jews in all Europe--she met Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto (1835-1914), later Pope Pius X.   She married Cesare Sarfatti (1867-1924), a Jewish lawyer from Padua at age 18. Their honeymoon in Paris exposed her to Cézanne and Toulouse-Lautrec, enthusiasms that preceded Italian tastes. Moving to Milan in 1902 they became culturally active, hosting salons where, among others, the Futurist artists met.  Beginning in 1908, she wrote as art critic for the Socialist Party newspaper Avanti! forwarding a theme of bringing art to the masses. Here she highlighted the work of the Italian Futurists.  While attending the salons of the Russian socialist Anna Kuliscioff (1857-1925) she met Benito Mussolini in 1912, then a socialist activist and editor of the weekly Lotta di classe (The Class Struggle) published in Forli, Italy. The two became intermittent lovers. The populist initiatives of artists such as Giacomo Balla and the sculptor/illustrator Duilio Cambelotti came in for her praise in a 1912 article.  She abandoned the Futurists when their works followed the Cubist style. Boccioni's non-Futurist portrait of Busoni in 1916, brought her approval as a ""return to order."" Her favorite among these artists was Mario Sironi. Her eldest son, Roberto, enlisted in World War I and was killed at Monte Baldo in 1918. Sarfatti and Mussolini now edited Avanti!; the two left the Socialist Party in 1917 to contribute to Popolo d’Italia and later editing Mussolini's periodical Gerarchia. Between 1922, when Mussolini became dictator, and 1929 Sarfatti was the closest woman to him, his wife remaining in Milan.  When Sarfatti's husband died in 1924 she was free to author a highly propagandistic biography of Mussolini which appeared first in English in 1925 as The Life of Benito Mussolini.  The importance of the subject and Sarfatti's familiarity with him rocketed her fame. Her art- and literary salons became the most important in Italy. Attempts to champion the moderate artists of  and Novecento Italiano as the ideal of fascism met with scorn on both the left and right and by 1929 Mussolini distanced himself from her and the movement. She continued to publish on art, bringing a fascist point of view to modernism. Segni, colori e luci: note d'arte appeared the same year and Storia della pittura moderna in 1930. Artists closest to her, the painter Mario Sironi and the architect Giuseppe Terragni, solid Fascists were prominent in the 1932 Mostra della Rivoluzione Fascista (Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution). Sarfatti toured the US in 1934 as a public relations gesture for the dictator including a meeting with President Franklin Roosevelt. Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany required the government to adopt laws excluding Jews in 1938. Sarfatti, who, expecting this, had converted to Catholicism in the late 1920s, was still compelled to flee Italy, first for Paris, then Argentina and later Uruguay. There she wrote for the newspaper El Diario of Montevideo and published a book on Giorgioni, Giorgione: el pintor misterio in 1944. After the war she returned to Italy in 1947 and to art though she increasingly led a life of solitude.    She died at the villa di Cavallasca in 1961. Her papers are housed at the Archivio del '900, Mart (Museo d'arte moderna e contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto), Rovereto, Italy.Though “greedy, calculating, thirsty for power, arrogant, opinionated, and self-centered” (Cannistraro and Sullivan), no other woman achieved a comparable position in the Italian art world in the twentieth century (Lyttelton). Sarfatti's intelligence is evidenced by her appreciation for Ruskin’s for his singular mind--not the traditional view of a devotee of Venential gothic--but rather as an anti-orthodoxy exponent of artists like J.W. M. Turner.  Neither a strict social realist like both the socialist and Fascist regimes under which she wrote, she held that the moral and educative functions of art had to be clear for the masses. To Sarfatti only a modern art could address this spirit. These included fin-de-siècle avant-garde movements such as the Viennese Secession, Symbolism and Italian Divisionism were acceptable and the early paintings of the Futurists, though never Cubism. Her championing of the primacy of Italian art was always in distinction to French. Israel Zangwill’s story “Chad Gadya” is a moderately fictionalized portrait of the Grassini family.  Sarfatti's portrait appears with her daughter, Fiammetta, in frescoes by Guido Cadorin the (now) Grand Hotel Palace. In 1999 she was portrayed by Susan Saradon in a fictitious story, Cradle Will Rock. ","The Life of Benito Mussolini,  New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company,1925; Segni, colori e luci: note d'arte.

Milanesi studied law, but never completed a degree. Instead, his talents at discerning Italian scripts and handwriting led him to the Biblioteca Comunale at Siena and the sources pertaining to art history. He set about transcribing and publishing with Lorenzo Ilari, an index to this collection, a project which he worked on throughout his life. In 1842 Milanesi joined the periodical L'Antologia, founded in 1821. Together with his brother, Carlo (1816-1867), father Vincenzo Marchese (1808-1891) and Carlo Pini (1806-1879), Milanesi 1845 founded the Società di Amatori delle Belle Arti. The group published a scholarly edition of Vite dei pittori by Giogrio Vasari from 1846 and 1870, exposing the numerous errors of Vasari in a systematic way. In 1848 he was named Ispettore of the Accademia fiorentina di Belle Arti. In 1854 Milanesi published his Documenti per la storia dell'arte senese the first in his series of published primary sources in Sienese art history largely from the Archivio dell'Opera de Duomo in Orvieto. Milanesi continued his series of documents, mostly on Siena and Florence art and artists. In 1856 he moved to Florence as the ""resident academic"" at the Accademia della Crusca. In 1858 was appointed Deputy Director of the Archivio di Stato in Florence and in 1864 succeeded the founder as editor of the guida dell'Archivio Storico. The same year he and Pini published a collection of artists' writing which included photographic examples of the script. He published an edition of the letters of Michelangelo in 1875. A second, nine-volume edition of the Vasari Lives appeared between 1878 and 1885 correcting errors of the first edition and including all known Vasari writings. Milanesi became Arciconsolo of the Accademia della Crusca in 1883. Finally, he was appointed Soprintendente degli Archivi Toscani in 1889, which he held for the next two years. Milanesi's publications form the starting point for modern Italian art history. His revaluing of Vasari was based in the Positivist belief that sources could uncover an accurate truth. The archival publications he wrote greatly supported the findings, among others of the American art historians Bernard Berenson and Richard Offner, who used his research extensively.","Documenti per la storia dell'arte senese, raccolti ed illustrati. 3 vols.

"Milizia, Francesco","Milizia, Francesco","","1725","1798","Oria, Kingdom of Naples; [near Otranto; present day Apulia, Italy]","Rome, Italy","Italy","male","","","Italian art- and archtiectural historian, theorist and biographer; articulated the 18th-century sentiment against the Baroque. Milizia stemmed from an ancient noble family. When he was nine years old he was placed in the charge of his maternal uncle, a physician and university professor in Padua where Milizia became fascinated by science and technology. At sixteenth he ran away to Rome to live with his father. His father sent him to Naples to study physics, math, science and philosophy with the writer Antonio Genovesi (1713-1769). Milizia took further studies in France, returning to Italy and in 1750 where he married a wealthy woman from Gallipoli. In 1761 he returned to Rome, joining the circle of art literatti which included the Spanish diplomatist and art collector Don José Nicholas De Azara (1731-1804), the German painter Anton Raphael Mengs, and the first modern art historian, Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He received the appointment of Superintendent of the Farnese Buldings in the Papal See from King Ferdinand IV of Naples. By 1768 Milizia, in cooperation with Azara, Mengs and Winckelmann, annonymously published the first of a series of influential theoretical books, a biographical dictionary of architects, Le Vite di più celebri architetti d'ogni nazione e d'ogni tempo. The book is preceded by an essay on architecture wherein he outlines his principles. He followed this with a work of drama theory, Del Teatro in 1772. He resigned his appointment in 1780 to devote himself to writing. His most important work appeared the following year as the Principj di architettura civile. In it, he theorized what he considered the rational principles of architecture. Milizia's interest remained in fine arts theory however. His Dell'arte di vedere nelle belle arti del disegno secondo i principi di Sulzer e di Mengs also appeared in 1781. The third edtion of his Le Vite appeared that year as well, the first of the editions to bear his name. Milizia resigned his Superintendency for the King in 1782 to devoted himself to writing and translations of his own works with the collaboration of the important Italian neoclassical architects of the period, e.g., Giovanni Antonio Antolini (1753-1841). An architectural treatice, the first of an intended mult-volume set on the arts, Roma delle belle Arti del disegno was published in 1787. A second work on the theater, Discorso sul teatro appeared in 1789. Milizia next issued his Dizionario delle belle arti del disegno in 1797, an enlightenment work which, among other entries, famously characterized the Baroque, ""Barocco è il superlativo del bizzarro, l'eccesso del ridicolo."" He also wrote very detailed biographies of the most important artists of the times, including Borromini, Bernini and Pietro da Cortona. His views were so extreme he became persona non grata in Rome (Kaufmann). At his death in 1798, a portion of his library was donated to the national Library of Rome as well as his letters and manuscripts. Manuscripts and letters are also at Biblioteca del Seminario of Padua; his last will and testament is at the National Archives of Rome (ASR 30 Notai Capitolini, ufficio 25, notaio Salvi, 23 marzo 1798, f. 615). Milizia's writings on art theory, lives of artists, and his historical research were highly influential on his and the ensuing generations of art historians.His basic architectural theory was drawn from Vitruvius to which he added strong personal views. Although he at times approved of Baroque architecture, he desparaged it later as well as much of Michelangelo's work, including sacristy decorations of St. Peter's and his sculpture of Moses. His animadversion of Baroque architecture set taste against this style until the end of the 19th century when Cornelius Gurlitt rehabilitated the thinking on the subject as once again worthy of study. Milizia considered himsself a cultural theorist, writing studies ranging from theatre studies to art literature and theory. Although his architectural theory suggested that ancient architecture was exhausted as a style, his writings did much to promote Neo-classical architecture. Neither a leader nor an original mind, his writings reflect the changes in architectural taste of the eighteenth century, a fact he admitted to by terming himself a ""heterogenous compound of contradictions"" (Kaufmann). Articles about Milizia and his writing began to appear as early as 1808.","and Monaldini, Giuseppe Antonio.

"Morelli, Giovanni","Morelli, Giovanni","Giovanni Morelli","1816","1891","Verona, Italy","Bergamo, Italy","Italy","male","","","Italian patriot and art historian; developer of a method of connoisseurship which identified attribution via minute characteristics of artists. Morelli was born to a protestant family, a minority in Italy (originally of French Huguenot decent). Raised in Bergamo, he attended the (Swiss) Kantonschule at Aarau between 1826 and 1832. From 1833-1838 he studied medicine at the universities of Munich and Erlangen because of the Italian proscription against protestants in universities. His study of anatomy and human observation assisted him in forming his conclusions in later years regarding connoisseurship. Morelli graduated in medicine under the anatomist Ignaz Döllinger (1770-1841), but never practiced. His early interest in iconography appeared in a mock iconographical study, under the pseudonym Nicholas Schäffer in 1836. A second parody on the aesthetic approach to art was published in 1839, again under the Schäffer pseudonym, Das Miasma Diabolicum. Morelli traveled to Berlin in 1838 where he me naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), the artists Karl Blechen (1802-1872), Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853), the architect Wilhelm Stier (1799-1856), but most importantly, the art historians Karl Friedrich von Rumohr and Berlin Museum director Gustav Friedrich Waagen. That same year he was instrumental in assisting the geological morphology of the Swiss geologist, Louis Agassiz (1807-1873). Until 1840, Morelli lived in Paris, where he gave up science for good and met the dealer Otto Mündler. It was Mündler who gave Morelli his first introduction to art connoisseurship. Morelli returned to Italy in 1840, embracing his birth country and acting as a conduit for the intellectual traditions of the north. He translated Johann Pieter Eckermann's conversations with Goethe (though never published) and Friedrich Schelling's lectures on his aesthetics in 1845 and on Dante in 1858. Morelli served in the Risorgimento of Italy in the 1860s, becoming a Senator in unified Italy in 1873. He chaired many commissions in the new government on art, most important were the ones enacting legislation forbidding export of art treasures from Italy and the standardization of conservation practices in Italian museums, the latter with restorers Luigi Cavenaghi (1844-1918) and Giovanni Secco-Suardo (1798-1873). Perhaps through his previous connections with Mündler, who had worked for the National Gallery in London and now sold them pictures, he met British collectors in Milan, including Charles Lock Eastlake, Sir James Hudson (1810-1885), British ambassador at Turin, and the amateur archaeologist Austen Henry Layard. Morelli acquired pictures for Layard and was among the first to whom he taught his technique of connoisseurship. Only after age sixty did Morelli published his famous methodology of art history. It first appeared as a series of articles in the Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst beginning in 1876 and later as book in 1880. His treatise, Die Werke italienischer Meister, was written in German under the pseudonym ""Ivan Lermolieff"" (a Russian-ized anagram of the Italian form his name). The work is a dialogue between an Italian master scholar (Schwarze) and his Russian pupil, Lermolieff, ostensibly the author of the book. Their topics were the major paintings in the galleries of Rome, Dresden, and Berlin. Eric Fernie points that the conversational organization of the book allowed Morelli to criticize contemporary approaches and individual scholar's opinions on art. The book contested may accepted attributions. The two personalities discuss works with the Italian often reattributing the work, and the Russian providing supporting evidence (a drawing, for example he knows) as well popular responses. In this way, Morelli could criticize a work of art without ever declaring it a fake. Morelli followed this with a series of articles on Raphael, appearing between 1881 and 1882. His collected writings, Kunstkritische Studien, edited by himself, were published beginning in 1890. The same year he met the young Bernard Berenson, who became perhaps the most important exponent of Morelli's method. Morelli provided letters of introduction to many sacristans to allow Berenson to examine works of art for his later, famous books. Morelli died before the third volume of his critical studies appeared; the volume was subsequently edited by Gustavo Frizzoni. His immediate influence was on Frizzoni as well as the art historians Jean Paul Richter, Adolfo Venturi, Berenson, and Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes. In 1893, Richter's wife translated Die Werke italienischer Meister into English. Morelli's connoisseurship employing identification of the ""hands"" of an artist--both literally and in the figurative sense of the characteristics of representation--was immensely popular for a group of art historians who immediately followed his generation. Scholars as different as J. D. Beazley, Berenson and Julius Alwin von Schlosser used his technique directly to establish their own reputations (Schlosser wrote effusively of his meeting with Morelli, arranged by Franz Wickhoff). This technique, frequently termed ""scientific"" art history in the 19th and early 20th-century, contrasted with documentary and scholars who viewed art history as a historical phenomenon, such as Joseph Archer Crowe and G. B. Cavalcaselle. His scientific classification drew from his time with Döllinger and the French comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier (1769-1832). Morelli's conversancy with German academics allowed him to debate the issues of art history on their terms. His approach to renaissance art contrasts that of, for example, Wilhelm Bode, director of the Berlin Musuem, whose art history was heavily theoretical. Freud used Morelli's method in his 1914 study of Michelangelo's Moses and an aspect of the approach found favor with Edgar Wind in a 1963 essay. Morelli's reattributions though wide-ranging, largely met with acceptance. Overall, Morelli possessed a strong anti-intellectualism.

Orlandi corresponded with artists and collectors in Rome and Florence to obtain updated information for the new edition, which elevated the Abecedario's status from a collection of biographies to a handbook about art and artistic practices. The book included bibliographies on books about artists as well as information about history, mythology, and poetry. In this sense, it constitutes one of the earliest art bibliographies every written. During the 19th century, the Abecedario was criticized for its inaccuracy by Giuseppe B. Campori

Orsini was an illegitimate child of a member of the noble Orsini family in Rome, probably of Maerbale Orsini. Abandoned by his father, he aligned himself with the choir boys of S Giovanni in Laterano and their protector Canon Gentile Delfini (d.1559), himself in the service of Cardinal Ranuccio Farnese (1530-1565). Orsini studied ancient languages, rising in the church until by 1554 he was a cannon. In 1559, at Delfini's death, he moved into the Farnese patronage where he became secretary and librarian to the Cardinal himself. At Ranuccio Farnese's death in 1565, his successor, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, kept him on as librarian adding to his duties keeper of the antiques and art work in the villa, Palazzo Farnese. Orsini acquired new works for Farnese collection, including drawings by Michelangelo, Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo and others. He began collecting art personally, owning at least two paintings by El Greco, which may have been payment for steering Farnese commissions to certain artists. He also supplied inscriptions for the Cardinal's commissions, and most importantly, developed the iconographic programs for the Farnese frescos in the Villa Farnese in Caprarola. As an historian, he published a history of Rome, Familiæ Romanæ ex antiquis numismatibus in 1577. As a linguist, he wrote a new edition of Arnobius of Sicca apologetics in 1583 and the Septuagint in 1587. Cardinal Alessandro died in 1589 and Orsini came into service of his third Farnese master, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese. He continued to oversee Farnese art interests, including composing the iconographic program for Annibale Carracci's Camerino frescoes in the Palazzo Farnese. At his death, his collection passed to Odoardo Farnese. His collection are still part of the Farnese collection now at Capodimonte and Mus. Archeol. in Naples. Orsini held a deep interest in ancient iconography. In 1570 he published his Imagines et elogia virorum illustrium, a study of portraiture, which laid the groundwork for a new methodology for the study of classical portraiture. Orsini used all media, coins, sculpture, gems and inscriptions in his quest for reliable images. Orsini's broad scholarship was followed by ever newer iconographies in succeeding generations, including Bellori's Veterum illustrium philosophorum of 1685.","Imagines et elogia virorvm illvstrivm et ervditor ex antiqvis lapidibvs et nomismatib.

Pallucchini's father was a civil engineer who moved his family to Venice in 1925. The younger Pallucchini was introduced to Venetian art by Maria Ciartoso Lorenzetti, whose husband, Giulio Lorenzetti (1886-1951), was writing the famous guidebook on the city. He graduated from college in 1931 from the University of Padua, writing his senior thesis on Giambattista Piazzetta and his school under Giuseppe Fiocco, a pioneer of art history in the Veneto area. His study of Piazzetta became his first book which appeared in 1934. In 1935 Pallucchini was appointed Inspector ""ispettore"" for fine arts at the Galleria Estense in Modena. At Modena, he worked with Roberto Longhi, the eminent but much older art historian with a significantly different approach. Pallucchini delivered lectures on medieval and modern art history in 1937. He was appointed director of the Galleria in 1939 writing the catalog for the Veronese exhibition at Ca Giustinian. The same year he transferred to the Superintendent position for Venetian museums, holding additionally the Directorate Belle Arti del Comune (until 1950). From that time on--the late 1930s--virtually no major exhibition or conference on Venetian art took place without his participation (Boucher). Art exhibitions under the Mussolini were difficult and nearly impossible after the closure of public collections in 1940. Pallucchini managed to mount Venetian Engravers of the Eighteenth Century in 1941. After the war, two important shows, ""Cinque secoli di pittura veneta"" in 1945 (a catalog of which included the famous essay by Longhi), and ""I capolavori dei Musei veneti,"" 1946 were created by him. The same year, 1946, Pallucchini founded the important periodical Arte Veneta, whose initial contributors included Hans Tietze, Bernard Berenson, Longhi, and Lionello Venturi. Another exhibition, Giovanni Bellini was mounted in 1949 His worldview of art led to the position of secretary-general of the Venice Biennale in 1947, which he held until 1954. In 1950 he was appointed chair of medieval and modern art history at the University of Bologna, succeeding Longhi. The same year he published his La giovinezza del Tintoretto, an attempt to reconstruct the formative years of Tintoretto's career as well as the milieu of Venetian art of the 1540's and 1550s. He moved as chair of modern art history in 1956 to his alma mater, Padua, working again with Fiocco. Pallucchini chaired the academic council of the Centro Andrea Palladio in Vicenza, beginning in 1958 (to 1973), assisting in establishing its Bulletin. In 1972 he became Director of the Institute of History of Art Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice, whose annual conferences influenced much Venetian scholarship. Pallucchini chaired two Corso internazionale di alta cultura, one in 1976 on Titian and one in 1978 on Giorgione. He retired from Padua in 1978, having greatly enlarged the art history program there. He co-authored a two-volume catalogue raisonné of Tintoretto with Paola Rossi in 1982. Pallucchini was an important historian of Venetian nineteenth-century Italian art. Pallucchini was influenced in French culture by the writer Diego Valeri (1887-1976). The art historians Giulio Carlo Argan, Lionello Venturi, and Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti were among his colleagues and friends. Methodologically, he followed a Vienna-school approach, particularly that of Max Dvořák and Arnold Hauser, the historical-philological of ""pure visibility"" (Purovisibilismo).","L'arte di Giovanni Battista Piazzetta.

Patin was born in Paris, but spent a majority of her life in Padua, Italy. She came from a family of intellectuals. Her father, Charles Patin, (1633-1693) was a physician and numismatist (whose work helped the art historian  Joachim von Sandart. Her grandfather, Guy Patin (1601-1672), also practiced medicine as an eminent French physician. Most distinguished of all, her mother, Magdeleine Homanet, (1640-1682), wrote moral philosophy. In 1679, Patin and her sister reunited with their father in Italy where he had fled, escaping a life sentence for the importation of seditious books. The family settled in Padua.

Patin was raised in a family that advocated for the scholarship of women. During her father's tenure the University of Padua graduated its first female doctoral candidate, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia (1646-1684) in 1678. He strongly encouraged his daughters to further their respective scholarly pursuits and obtain a doctorate. However, the University of Padua decided against awarding additional doctorates to women, thus barring Patin from obtaining her’s. Because of both her own passions for Italian art and her father’s support, she was able to publish her own work and be regarded as a scholar through the Paduan Accademia dei Ricovrati (later the Accademia Galileiana or “Galilean academy”), one of the only academic societies that accepted women during that time period. Patin's older sister, Gabrielle Patin (1666-1751), was a painter and numismatist.

There, in 1683, she delivered a Latin oration on the relief of Vienna following the siege of the Ottoman Turks. She published that oration alongside a catalogue of Italian works from Titian, Veronese, Bassano, and Tintoretto in Pitture Scelte E Dichiarate, in Italian, and Tabellae Selectae Ac Explicatae, the Latin counterpart. That year, she delivered a lecture in Latin on the siege of Vienna, which she published as Oratio de liberata civitate Vienna. Her sister, Gabrielle Charlotte (b. Paris ca. 1666), and mother, were also members of the society and wrote on theology, literature, and philosophy. Patin likewise published texts on these subjects in Latin, Italian, and French.

Her most well-known work, a critique of 41 Italian Renaissance paintings reproduced by multiple engravers, including the engraver Joseph Juster (active ca. 1690), was published in 1691 in Latin as Tabellæ selectæ ac explicatæ. The corresponding Italian translation, Pitture scelte e dichiarate, was brought out the same year. The volume also includes a print reproduction of the Patin family portrait painted by Noël Jouvenet in the late 1680s (d. 1698). Patin entered a convent in 1697, after which date her presence drops off the historical record. In 1745 a text titled Mitra, ou la Démone mariée: Nouvelle Hébraïque et morale, which she had ostensibly written in 1688, was printed by the fictitious publisher, “Démonopolis.”

Pittaluga continued study under Adolfo, where was training scholars to help write his Storia dell' Arte Italiana. He also assigned her to compile the texts for secondary curriculum in art history for the Liceo Classico. She began teaching in Florence in the 1920s. She published actively in her field, La Pittura Italiana del 400 and the first serious study of Italian engravings by an Italian, L'incisione Italia del 500, both in 1929. L'Architettura Italiana del 400 followed in 1934. In 1938 she produced both La Scultura Italiana del 400 and the first volume of La Pittura Italiana del 500 (the second volume in 1946). She wrote a three-volume survey on world art, from Minoan to twentieth-century, a landmark textbook including plans and glossaries. After the war her family fortune declined and she relied on this text for a part of her income. In 1948 she continued her research on French Salon criticism, publishing in the Biblioteca di Critica d'arte. By the 1950s her interest had moved to nineteenth-century Italian art. She did, however, provide the text for the English-language volume of Raphael's panel paintings for the Abrams series. Pittaluga retired before the standard pension age in order to devote her last years to publishing in nineteenth-century art. A book on De Nittis appeared in 1963 and another on Ippolito Caffi in 1971, with articles interspersed in the Florentine Antichita Viva. Pittaluga employed connoisseurship as her major approach to art. Bernard Berenson, who generally despised female art historians and academics alike, made an exception for Pittaluga. He characterized her worth as equal to all other Italian colleages. The painter and author A. Derek Hill (1916-2000) described her as the female, twentieth-century Voltaire.","Acquafortisti veneziani del Settecento. Florence: Le Monnier, 1953; La pittura italiana del Cinquecento.

Poggi was appointed Director of the Uffizi in 1912, and reformed the administrations of several Italian musuems, making them more organized and better maintained. He merged the Uffizi with the Galleria Antica e Moderna, which was renamed the Galleria dell'Accademia. In 1925, Poggi was named Soprintendente dell'Arte Medievale e Moderna for the Tuscany region. As a scholar, Poggi's biggest project was as an editor of an edition of Michaelangelo's correspondences. The project involved dozens of scholars, but the collection and documentation of the letters was slow.

"Portoghesi, Paolo","Portoghesi, Paolo","","1931","","Rome, Italy","","Italy","male","","","Early Post-modern architect; architectural historian and Borromini scholar. Portoghesi described himself as having been born ""in the shadow of Borromini's San Ivo"" (Steinberg) and hence much of his professional life as an architectural historian revolved around this architect. He entered the University of Rome, writing articles on Borromini in 1953 through 1955 and also a booklet on Borromini's monuments in the Lateran Basilica I monumenti borrominiani della Basilica Lateranense the same year. Portoghesi graduated with a degree in architecture in 1957 and in the history of art in 1958. In 1959 he was appointed Professor at the school of advanced studies in the study and restoration of monuments. As an architect, Portoghesi designed in a neo-Baroque style, first exemplified in 1959 in the Casa Baldi (Via Flaminia, Rome). Making use of the traditional tufa material of ancient homes, he worked to relate his buildings to their contexts, both social and physical. The following year, 1960, he published a work on the eighteenth-century architect Bernardo Antonio Vitone, ""Metodo e poesia nell'architettura di B. A. Vittone"" (""Method and poetry in the architecture of B.A. Vittone""). He began teaching a course on architectural criticism at the University in 1961. Portoghesi and Bruno Zevi edited a festschrift for Giulio Carlo Argan in 1964, Michelangelo Architetto. That year, too, Portoghesi published his book Borromini nella cultura europea (""Borromini in European Culture"") and launched an architectural practice with Vittorio Gigliotti near Porta Pinciana in Rome. His commissions of this era included the Casa Andreis (1964-1967). He was appointed professor of the history of public architecture in Baroque Rome in 1966. A critical edition of Leon Battista Alberti: l'architettura and a second work on Vittone, Bernardo Vittone, un architetto tra Illuminismo e Rococò (""Bernardo Vittone, an architect between the Enlightenment and the Rococo"") were published. Portoghesi was appointed professor of History of Architecture at Milan Polytechnic in 1966 as well. The following year Portoghesi published his important Borromini, Architettura come linguaggio which was translated in English as The Rome of Borromini: Architecture as Language. In 1968 he became dean of the Faculty of Architecture of Milan Polytechnic, issuing L'Eclettismo a Roma (""Eclecticism in Rome"") and Editor-in-chief of the Dizionario di Architettura e Urbanistica or ""DAU"". Another important architectural commission with Gigliotti, Casa Papanice, was completed 1969-1970. In 1976, Portoghesi's most outstanding commission, the mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre in Rome was dedicated. He was appointed professor of architecture at the University of Milan the same year, where he taught until 1980. He next headed the architecture section at the Venice Biennial. That year, too, 1980, he accepted a professorship in architectural history at the University of Rome and published Dopo l'architettura moderna (""After modern architecture""). In 1982 Portoghesi became Professor of History of Architecture at Rome University. He accepted the Editor-in-chief position of Materia magazine in 1990. Portoghesi was named full professor of Urban Planning at ""La Sapienza,"" University in Rome in 1995. A 1974 manifesto, Le inibizioni dell'architettura moderna outlined his practicing architectural theory as a ""system of places"". With Zevi, he promoted a modernists who, in their architecture, related their work to its environment, (e.g., Victor Horta and Frank Lloyd Wright). He was a founder of the first international exhibition of Post-modernist architecture (Venice Biennale,1980). Like many post-modern architects, he design furnishings of his buildings. He engaged in a celebrated debate (along with Zevi) countering the criticisms of Manfredo Tafuri on the purposes of architectural history.","I monumenti borrominiani della Basilica Lateranense.

"Praz, Mario","Praz, Mario","Mario Praz","1896","1982","Rome, Italy","Rome, Italy","Italy","male","","","Interdisciplinary arts writer, literary critic and art historian (particularly of decorative arts). Praz was the son of Luciano Praz, a clerk in a bank and Giulia Testa di Marsciano (Praz). He attended the University of Rome, gaining a law degree in 1918. Moving to the University of Florence, he was granted a bachelor of letters degree in 1920. Praz earaned a scholarship and left Italy for England in 1923 to earn his libero docente (Ph.D). He worked at the British Museum, which gained him entrance as a professor of Italian Studies at the University in Liverpool in 1924. He delivered the British Academy annual Italian Lectures in 1928 on Machiavelli. During his tenure in Liverpool, he wrote his most important work for art history, Carne, la morte e il diavolo nella letteratura romantica in 1930 and translated into English as The Romantic Agony 1933. The study was one of the first interdisciplinary ones on the arts to include art history. By tracing the embedded and overt erotic and Sadistic impulses in the Romantic movement through all of the arts: art, literature and music, Praz deftly characterized the interrelation of these themes among the Romantic era. In 1932 he moved to Manchester University, also teaching Italian studies. He married the British subject Vivyan Eyles (b. 1910) in 1934 and returned to Italy the same year to become professor of English Literature at Rome University with the title cattedra di Letteratura inglese alla Sapienza. The couple initially lived on the via Giulia, at the Palazzo Ricci where their home was a meeting point for visitors across Europe. Praz's 1939 study of baroque art, Studi sul concettismo, showed his knowledge of emblemata and included an important bibliography on the subject. The following year Praz published his volume on Neoclassical taste and art, Gusto neoclassico, another period at its nadir in public opinion. Praz continued to hold his chair at the University of Rome during the Fascist period through World War II and the German occupation. His interest in decorative arts, particularly furniture increased but led to his divorce from Eyles in 1947, she claiming, wryly, that he cared more about his furniture than her. In 1961 he wrote the introduction for Magnificenza di Roma's republication of Prianesi's Vedute. Praz collected furniture and decoration in the Empire and Regency styles, leading to his history of interior design in 1964, La filosofia dell'arredamento. He retired in 1966 emeritus. Among the works Praz translated were text by the art critic/theorist Walter Pater. Praz contributed the essay, ""Francesco Pianta's Bizarre Carvings,"" to the 1967 Festschrift of Rudolf Wittkower. In 1969 Praz moved from his Ricci palace home to the third floor of the Primoli palace, near the Piazza Navona, where he spent his final years. In 1967 he delivered the A. W. Mellon lectures at the National Gallery of Art, Washgington, D. C., which were published in 1970 as Mnesomyne: the Parallel Between Literature and the Visual Arts. In 1976 he authored a volume on the complete works of the sculptor Anontio Canova. Praz died in Rome in 1982. His Palazzo Primoli home was opened to the public in as a museum in 1995. A monograph on Canova remains untranslated. Most of Praz's publications discussed Romantic and Neo-classical art and literature. The Romantic Agony analyzes the erotic details in the works of Baudelaire, Sade, Flaubert, and Wilde. As an art historian, also wrote a catalog of his personal decorative arts collection arranged as an autobiography, entitled, La casa della vita. The catalog describes objects in Praz's home, accompanied by personal anecdotes that give the reader intimate insight into the life of a collector. Praz was largely responsible for the excellent translations into Italian for English-language writers, including Pater. Among American literary critics, Edmund Wilson (1895-1972) was a strong exponent, who characterized Praz's autobiography House of Life as a masterpiece. The art historian and literary critic Wylie Sypher also praised Praz's literary work.","[bibliography to 1966:] ""A Bibliography of the Published Writings of Mario Praz."" in, Gabrieli, Vittorio, ed.

"Previtali, Giovanni","Previtali, Giovanni","","1934","1988","Florence, Italy","Naples, Italy","Italy","male","","","Italianist, Giotto and Bellori scholar. Previtali came from a family of prominent musicians, his father was the conductor Fernando Previtali (1907-1985) and his mother the daughter of the conductor Vittoria Gui (1885-1975). He studied art history under Roberto Longhi. He assumed the editorship of Longhi's magazine, Paragone. In 1961 he was appointed to the University of Messina. In 1964 he published a pioneering study of reception of medieval art, La fortuna dei primitivi dal Vasari ai neoclassici. He followed this with his 1967 Giotto e la sua bottega, a book placing Giotto in the context of his followers. Though he agreed with his other Italian colleagues, Longhi, Pietro Toesca and others that the St. Francis cycle was Giotto's conception but not his accomplishment, his book framed the question in terms of his specific accomplishment, rather than, as viewed by Richard Offner, a question of ""Giotto or non-Giotto"" (Castelnuovo). The same year he and Paola della Pergola and Luigi Grassi brought out a nine-volume edition of Varsari's 1568 edition of the Lives. Previtali contributed to a film on Giotto, adapted and issued in English as ""Giotto and the Pre-Renascence [sic],"" narrated by Richard Basehart, in 1969. His academic career was followed with teaching positions at Siena and Naples through 1971. By the early 1970s, dissention from the other members of Paragone, also Longhi students, arose regarding whether classical art subjects should be included. In 1975, Previtali and the archaeologist Mauro Cristofani (1941-1997) founded the art journal Prospettiva, open to all areas of art history. In 1976 Previtali wrote an introduction to the Italian translation of the Shape of Time by George Kubler. His interest in historiography continued with an essay in the Einaudi series, Storia dell'arte italiana on ""La periodizzazione della storia dell'arte italiana"" in 1979. In the 1980s he curated two exhibitions during the years he taught at Siena. These included Gotico a Siena (1982) and Simone Martini. He died at age 54. His periodization essay appeared in an English translation in 1994. Previtali's main area of scholarship was the Italian Gothic. Articles first in Paragone (1965-1970) and then in Prospettiva (1983-1986) on Gothic Umbrian sculpture were particularly original. La fortuna dei primitivi dal Vasari ai neoclassici traced the changes in attitude toward medieval (""primitives"") from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century. It launched an career interest in art criticism. Previtali's introduction to the Borea edition of Bellori's Lives, still the most important study devoted to the scholar, placed him for the first time in a truly historical context. Previtali both located him in the evolution of an aesthetic theory and in his own historical time. His evaluation of the Lives was not on the basis of the Idea, but as a work addressing the relations of power within artistic culture and society in Rome in the seventeenth century. Previtali asserted that ""Bellori was a true critic (beset with doubts, like every true critic, to a greater extent than is usually imagined) and at times a great one,"" i.e., profoundly sensitive to the values of figurative language. (Montanari). A Marxist politically and somewhat methodologically, he followed Longhi (especially the late Longhi) in addressing large-scale issues and questions of reception (Castelnuovo).","Scritti in ricordo di Giovanni Previtali. 2 vols.

"Ragghianti, Carlo Ludovico","Ragghianti, Carlo Ludovico","","1910","1987","Lucca, Italy","Florence, Italy","Italy","male","","","Art and architectural historian and critic, pioneer in the use of film as a tool of art history. Ragghianti's parents were Francesco Ragghianti Francesco, a surveyor, eventually (and automatically under fascist law) promoted to architect, and and Maria Cesari Ragghianti. Carlo Ragghianti attended the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa between 1928 and 1931, recently taken over by the fascist philosopher Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944) who had been appointed to transform secondary school education. There, Ragghianti found like-minded friends such as future philosopher and educator Aldo Capitini (1899-1968). Gentile's elevation to school director apparently caused rifts between the already anti-fascist Ragghianti. Ragghianti was dismissed from the school in 1931. He then studied at the university in Pisa under Matteo Marangoni. His dissertation written under Maragoni, was on the Baroque in art. Part of his thesis was published in the journal La Cultura under the title ""Cultura artistica e arte barocca"" in 1932. In 1933, the philosopher and art writer Benedetto Croce urged Ragghianti to publish further portions of the thesis in Croce's journal La Critica under the title ""I Carracci e la critica d'arte nell'eta Barocca."" In 1935, Ragghianti and the classicist art historian Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli founded the journal Critica d'Arte which, unlike other art journals, was open to all areas of art history, classical to modern. Important contributors to the journal included Roberto Longhi. Critica d'Arte became the model for other Italian art magazines, most notably Prospettiva, founded by Giovanni Previtali and Mauro Cristofani (1941-1997). Ragghianti joined the faculty at Pisa where he taught until 1972. During World War II, he was part of the Resistenza against fascism, helping found the second incarnation of the Partito d'Azione (after Mazzini's history 19th-century movement). Under the direction of the Ragionamenti sopra le invenzioni da lui dipinte, he published an edition of Lives of the Artists by Giorgio Vasari beginning in 1942. In 1943 he organized armed resistance in Tuscany. Ragghianti was elected president of the Tuscan Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale (National Liberation Committee) or CLN and headed the provisional government that liberated Florence in 1944. After the war he was nominated undersecretary for the arts and theatre during the government of prime minister Ferruccio Parri (1890-1981). As a government arts administrator, he addressed university reform, pedagogy and protection of cultural artifacts. In 1946 his Commenti di critica d'arte (Comments on Art Criticism), a book on methodology and art theory, appeared as well as a book on Impressionism. Ragghianti founded the l'Istituto di Storia dell'Arte at the University in 1950, today the Dipartimento di Storia delle Arti (department of Art History). Beginning in 1952 he edited, with his wife Licia Collobi, seleARTE, underwritten by the industrialist Adriano Oivetti (1901-1960). At its height, the quarterly boasted a circulation of 55,000. The journal also spun off small films, which Ragghianti called Critofilms, beginning with the 1948 La deposizione di Raffaello. Between 1954 and 1963 Ragghianti shot 18 of his critofilms. His Profilo della critica d'arte in Italia (A Profile of Art Criticism in Italy) appeared two years later. A monograph, Mondrian e l'arte del XX secolo was published in 1963. His final Critofilm, Michelangiolo was issued in 1964. In 1967 he published a survey, Arte in Italia. Ragghianti was a supporter of the Raccolta nazionale di Disegni e Stampe (National Collection of Drawings and Prints) at the University of Pisa and the conservation institute, L'Università Internazionale dell'Arte (U.I.A.) (International University of Art) in Florence from its founding in 1969. His essays were collected as Arti della visione (Arts of Vision) beginning in 1975. In 1980, he and his wife established the Licia and Carlo L. Ragghianti Foundation and Study Centre on Art. The center comprises his library and photo collection. As minister for the arts, Ragghianti was instrumental in the introduction of the teaching of history and criticism of cinema in Italian universities. He was deeply influenced by the esthetics of Croce, particularly Croce's theory of ""pure visibility."" His dissertatin and later essay, ""I Carracci e la critica d'arte nell'età barocca"" (The Carraccis and Art Criticism in the Baroque age), employed Croce's approach toward poetry and prose on the arts. He also incorporated the work of other estheticians such as Konrad Fiedler, as well as the Vienna-School art historians Aloïs Riegl and Julius Alwin von Schlosser. Criticism, Ragghianti insisted, could be expressed in pictorial form through a visual tool. Ragghianti argued that cinema should be studied with the same tools as art history. For all this, Ragghianti was a conservative and dispaired the 20th-century abstraction of Cubism and others for the modeling of his countryman, Giancomo Manzu. Hand-written annotations about Ragghianti's opinions on Giotto appear in the personal copy of the 1937 Mostra Giottesca catalog of Richard Offner.","[complete bibliography:] Leoni Zanobini, Maria Teresa.

Ragusa was the second daughter of Andrea and Anna Ragusa from Sicily. As a child, Ragusa immigrated with her family and settled in New York City in 1931. Her older sister, Olga Ragusa (b. 1922), also pursued an academic career and was an accomplished scholar of Italian Studies and a professor at Columbia University. Ragusa received her BA from New York University and her MA and PhD from the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA), New York University. She completed her master’s thesis, “The Re-Use and Public Exhibition of Roman Sarcophagi During the Middle Ages and the Early Renaissance” in 1951. At the IFA, Ragusa studied with art historians Walter W. S. Cook and Richard Offner and was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to study at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1966, she completed her doctoral dissertation “A Gothic Psalter in Princeton: Garrett MS. 35” supervised by Harry Bober.For over three decades, Ragusa was a member of the research staff of the Index of Christian Art at Princeton University, under director Rosalie B. Green. Ragusa lectured and published widely on iconographic topics throughout her career. Her best-known publication was a collaborative work with Green, Meditations on the Life of Christ: An Illustrated Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century, published by the Princeton University Press in 1961. With this work, Ragusa and Green produced the first English translation in print from the medieval Italian text of the Meditations on the Life of Christ manuscript (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS. ital 115). Their introduction acknowledged the encouragement of art historian Erwin Panofsky in undertaking the project. Ragusa and Green’s publication, dedicated to Charles Rufus Morey, became important in making the manuscript available to a wider scholarly audience and remains a standard reference work on the Paris Meditations manuscript.In 1974, at their father’s death, Isa and Olga Ragusa assumed ownership of their father’s Italian bookstore and publishing house S. F. Vanni in New York City. When the bookstore closed in 2004, the Ragusa papers and remainder of the Vanni collection were donated to the Scuola d’Italia Guglielmo Marconi also in New York. In 2005, at her bequest, New York University offered the Isa Ragusa Travel Fund to support student travel grants. The IFA Alumni Newsletter quoted Isa Ragusa on the motivation of her gift, “It’s so important to see the object [in person].

In 1903 he was elevated to director of galleries and museum in Florence, remaining there until he received the assignment of Consiglio Superiore di Belle Arti (director-general of antiquities and fine arts) in Italy, 1906-19. Ricci's tenure as director included some of the most important archaeological excavations of the time. These included excavations of the Foro Romano (1898-1925) directed by Giacomo Boni (1859-1925), and the Baths of Diocletian. In 1911 Ricci was responsible the restoration and preservation of the imperial fora in Rome through his capacity as vice president of the committee. Though the archaeological finds were significant, Ricci was forced to destroy some of the fabric to allow for the Via dell'Impero. Ostensibly retired from public life, Ricci was elected the first president of the Istituto di archeologia Roma in 1922. Throughout his career, he issued many of his works in English first. Other works published in Italian were quickly translated in English and other languages. His publications enjoyed a strong following in Britain and the United States.","Art in Northern Italy.

"Ridgway, Bruni","Ridgway, Bruni","Brunilde Ridgway","1929","","Chieti, Italy","","Italy","female","","","Scholar of classical sculpture. Sismondo was the daughter of Giuseppe G. Sismondo, a career army officer, and Maria Lombardo (Sismondo). As a girl, Sismondo lived in Sicily and then Ethiopia where her father had been stationed during World War II. When her father was captured by the British in World War II and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Kenya, Sismondo secured a job as a telephone operator at police headquarters in Asmaria in Eritrea where she learned to speak English. After the war, she earned her high school diploma doing double courses, entering the University of Messina, where she was awarded a Laurea in Lettere Classiche in1953. She same year she won a scholarship to classical archaeology at Bryn Mawr College under the famous head of the department, Rhys Carpenter. She wrote her M.A. thesis under Carpenter on the chronology of archaic sculpture in 1954. Sismondo continued for her Ph.D., studying at the American School of Classical Studies, between 1955 and 1957. She taught as an instructor in archaeology at her alma mater, 1957-1960. Her Ph.D. was granted in 1958; her dissertation was on archaic sculptural styles. She married Henry W. Ridgway, Jr. (b. 1930), a physical therapist, the same year, changing her name to Ridgway. Ridgway accepted an appointment at Hollins College, Virginia, as an assistant professor and head of department of classics in 1960, but returned to Bryn Mawr the following year as an assistant professor, where she remained the rest of her career. She became a U. S. citizen in 1963 and was appointed associate professor in 1967. She directed the summer school program at American School of Classical Studies, Athens, in 1967 (and a second time, 1971). For the 1967-1968 Ridgway researched as a Member, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N. J. Promotion to (full) professor of archaeology at Bryn Mawr occurred in 1970, the same year as the appearance of her Severe Style in Greek Sculpture book. In 1977 she was named Rhys Carpenter Professor of Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology. That same year her second monograph on Greek sculptural styles, The Archaic Style in Greek Sculpture, appeared. The following year she was the Mellon visiting professor in fine arts, University of Pittsburgh. The third of her stylistic treatment of sculpture books, Fifth Century Styles in Greek Sculpture was published in 1981. Ridgway wrote a controversial essay in the Art Bulletin in 1986, the beginning of a series of guest essays on ""The State of the Discipline."" In it, she distanced herself from art history, decrying the field as the ""study of aesthetically pleasing objects, in a scale ranging from the beautiful artifact to the masterpiece."" Although much of her criticism was accepted by the art-historical community, the essays met with several replies defending art history. The same year she was part of a group of scholars charged with determining the authenticity a Greek Kouros, which the J. Paul Getty Museum was considering buying for $7 million. Ridgway pronounced the work genuine on stylistic grounds, joining the opinions of others such as the late Ernst Langlotz and Martin Robertson, and against those such as Federico Zeri and Thomas Hoving. Years later, the initial scientific proof for the work has collapsed and the certainly of the sculpture has again became clouded. She received the gold medal for distinguished achievement from the Archaeological Institute of America in 1988. She retired from Bryn Mawr in 1994. She oversaw 36 dissertations in her career, including Paul Rehak, Mary Sturgeon, Susan Kane and Anne Weis. Her book Second Chance: Greek Sculptural Studies Revisited appeared in 2004. Ridgway was a highly influential classical scholar noted for balancing a connoisseurship approach to sculpture with a solid knowledge of archaeology. As an art historian, she built her reputation on the traditional methodology of stylistic analysis of sculpture, a technique drawn from her mentor, Carpenter. Ridgway fell so much under his spell that she took notes on his undergraduate courses, ""not simply on what he said, but on how he said it."" But Ridgway disparaged the discipline of art history, considering herself a classicist who instead wrote on art. A crusader against the practice of smuggling art objects out of their country of origin, as the editor of the American Journal of Archaeology for eight years she refused to accept articles that pertained to objects of suspicious provenance.","[complete bibliography:] στεφαNvoσ [Stephanos]: Studies in Honor of Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway.

"Ridolfi, Carlo","Ridolfi, Carlo","","1594","1658","Lonigo, Vicenza, Italy","Venice, Italy","Italy","male","biographies","none","Art biographer, painter and collector; his biographies of more than 150 painters in the Venetian state contributed to his title, ""the Venetian Vasari."" Ridolfi's father was a tailor (he used the name Marco Sartor in his will), who died when the young Ridlofi was five. Eventually his mother, Angela, remarried and he entered the studio of a local German painter (Ridolfi was of German decent himself). At thirteen, he traveled to Venice to study uner Antonio Vassilacchi, known as l'Aliense. A diligent student, he made drawings from reliefs and assisted the master. He left Vassilacchi's studio after only five year because of dissatification with other students, and, after a brief stay at home, returned to Venice studying drawing. He also mastered history, architecture, and classical literature. Various commissions followed, but the great plague in Venice forced him to flee, living with a friend in Spineda. His mother, friends and some of his patrons were lost to the outbreak. Artistically, his paintings reflect the artistic influence of Tintoretto and Titian. Ridolfi collected drawngs, perhaps already styling himself after his earlier counterpart, Giorgio Vasari, assembling works in the 1630s by earlier masters Vittore Carpaccio and works attributed to Tintoretto and Leonardo da Vinci. By 1641 Ridolfi was in Dalmatia painting works now in a Mannerist style. His petition to the Venetian government to receive a ""favor,"" probably a pension, was refused. Ridolfi had also been collecting material for a life of Tintoretto, the first on that artist, and this appeared in 1642 as La vita di Giacopo Robusti. The success of this literary venture meant that Ridolfi was made a Knight of the Order of St. Mark by the Venetian Senate, perhaps because the Vita was dedicated to Doge Francesco Erizzo (d. 1646) and the Venetian Republic. He was knighted in 1645 by Pope Innocent X. Ridolfi published a life of Veronese in 1646. In 1648 he issued his major work, a complilation of more than 150 biographies of painters active in the Venetian Republic, Le meraviglie dell'arte (The Marvels of Art) including his Tintoretto biography as well as his own. The work provides a strong counter to Vasari's Vite (1550/1568) which was strongly biased against Venetian artists. Where Vasari had ignored and depricated Venetian talent, Le meraviglie dell'arte covers Venice artists in a positive light and contains the earliest reference, for example, to Giorgione's Castelfranco Altarpiece in San Liberale. Conversely it ignores Sebastiano del Piombo, a Venetian who spent most of his career in Rome. Ridolfi painted throughout his career. He married in 1656, but died of a fever two years later. Le meraviglie dell'arte was an important source for Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellens paintres anciens et modernes (1666ff.), by André Félibien. His collection of drawings survives in three volumes, dating from the 1630s at Oxford University, Christ Church Collection.

Ridolfi's Le meraviglie dell'arte is important in the history of art because it documents many Venetian art works gone today and locates a provenance for those still known. His work is the starting point in researching many major and minor Venetian artists. Like Vasari's Vite, many of Ridolfi's attributions were incorrect. Unlike Vasari, however, Ridolfi avoided a stylistic development of Venice; he considered the 16th-century Venetice the acme of its artistic production at the expense of his contemporaries. He also diverged from Vasari contending that painting was above all the other arts (Vasari consister paintng, sculpture and architecture equal). His basic premise countered Vasari's assertion that Florence had rediscovered the arts after the dissolution of the classical tradition in the Middle (Dark) Ages. Le meraviglie dell'arte instead maintained that artistic endeavor had never been lost in Venice because of the constant influence of the Byzantines. He took great pains to cite documents and letters supporting his arguments. Consistent with the writing of his age, Le meraviglie dell'arte contains many asides. Ridolfi sees creation of fine art as a closeness to God. Painting for him was the universal impulse that included all things within it. The work may have been supported financially by the Venetian government to counter Vasari's Vite of a hundred year before which was strongly biased against Venetian artists. Ridolfi's biography of Tintorietto was the first on the artist and remains an important early source on Tintoretto's working methods","Vita di Giacopo Robusti detto il Tintoretto, celebre pittore cittadino venetiano.

In 1877, Ridolfi organized the city of Lucca's first exhibition of historic works. He relocated to Florence, becoming the vice-director, and later the director of the city's art galleries. His goal was to reorganize the Galleria degli Uffizi. Under Ridolfi's supervision, the Uffizi's exhibition halls were expanded and redecorated, and paintings studied by well-known art historians such as Giovanni Morelli, Adolfo Venturi, and Bernard Berenson were prominently displayed. He also alleviated the overcrowding of the 17th century paintings in the Tribuna, and highlighted the gallery's recent purchases of 15th-century Flemish and Tuscan paintings such as the Portinari Alterpiece (c. 1473-9) by Hugo van der Goes.","","The Dictionary of Art","","","https://arthistorians.info/ridolfie"

Little is known about Giovanni Campani, who wrote under the name of Ceasare Ripa. He was not a professional scholar, although he was associated with literary academies in Siena and Perugia. Ripa wrote as a leisure pursuit when not working as majordomo to Cardinal Antonio Maria Salvini (1537-1602). Ripa's fame rests solely on one dictionary of iconographic forms that was used heavily in the baroque world. In 1593, Ripa published a manual in Rome called Iconologia, alphabetically arranging classical and baroque symbolism. The first edition appeared without illustrations. By the second edition of 1603, his categories of personifications, which were composed of over 700 concepts, formed a complete array of allegory to be observed in the art of the seventeenth century. The Iconologia was used both by viewers of art as well as by artists wishing to employ complex iconography in their work. The book was proscriptive, carefully outlining the decorum of image use as much as its meaning. Ripa had compiled his work from a variety of mythological manuals, emblemata (emblem books), archaeological compendia and discussions of numismatics. He was the first to consult a wide variety of media, including sculpture, medals, coins, waxes and engravings, although often the examples he cited had been gleaned only from other books. His printed sources, though unmentioned, included the mythological dictionary, Le imagini de i dei of 1556 by Vincenzo Cartari (b. ca. 1500) and the Hieroglyphica of 1556 by Pierio Valeriano (1477-1558). Although Ripa claimed his personifications were derived from antiquity and elsewhere, most of his examples were drawn from more modern sources. The Etruscan scholar Pietro Leone Casella (c.1540-c.1620) issued an amplified edition of the Iconologia, which thereafter saw numerous editions. Ripa fell out of favor during the Enlightenment era when the excesses of the baroque were disparaged. The art historian Émile Mâle rediscovered Ripa, at least for art history, in 1932. Today Ripa's Iconologia is an essential primary source for how baroque symbolism was understood. Although it is clear that artists used his interpretations liberally and sometimes not at all, other subsequent artistic compositions can be traced directly to Ripa. Giovan Francesco Guerrieri's paintings in the Palzzo Borghese in Rome and Francesco Pianta's carvings in the Scuola di San Rocco in Venice are peculiar representations that are taken directly from Ripa (Praz). Art historians and archaeologists use the Iconologia both as proof that specific symbols held specific meaning and as a paradigm for how personifications were transmitted.","[comprehensive bibliography:] Praz, Mario.

Rivoira was born the year of Victor Emmanuel's accession to power. His father was Franceso Rivoira (1814-1875), descended from an old Savoy family now in the Piedmont. His mother was related to the mathematician Jacopo Francesco Riccati (1676-1754). After attending the local Collegio, he enter the University of Turin where he studied engineering. He briefly worked supervising construction before the unification of Italy when he moved to Rome joining the army of General Cadorna and the ""liberation"" of the city. He joined the department of Posts and Telegraphs, rising to the position of secretary to the Director-General. The position allowed him much travel. He married an English woman in 1884, ten years later he read a paper on electricity to the British Association at Oxford. He made the strong friendship of the English classicist Gordon McNeil Rushforth (1862-1938), who subsequently translated Rivoira's books into English. In Italy, Rivoira experienced the monuments of Italy first hand. Although initially interested in painting, having read the work of Giovanni Morelli, he turned to architecture as a ""less crowded field."" He left his government post in 1899, embarking on a tour of architecture through the middle east, Greece, Spain and Germany. In 1901, Rivoira published the first volume of his Le origini dell'architetura lombardia, a book arguing that Rome was the source of medieval architecture. He traced the church of Hagia Sophia to the Thermae of ancient Rome and the Gothic from the Lombardic vaulted basilica such as Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. The same year, a University of Graz scholar, Josef Rudolf Thomas Strzygowski published his book Orient oder Rom, (Orient or Rome) arguing that Western art derived from Eastern origins. These antithetical and contemporary theories fueled a debate which would last Rivoira's life. In 1908 he travelled again to Constantinople and the Balkans (cut short by Armenia's cholera epidemic) and North Africa in 1910. He lectured at the American School of Classical Studies in Rome the same year on the architectural achievements of Hadrian, perhaps his most important synthetic work. Studies of Spanish and north African architecture confirmed his life-long thesis that even Islamic architecture owed much to Rome, which his second book, Architettura Musulmana, 1914, espoused. Rivoira returned to the Roman Empire as the source of all architecture in the West, writing his Architettura romana: costruzione e statica nell' età imperiale. The expansive book examined Roman architecture through the seventeenth century. The influenza pandemic of 1918 took his life early in 1919 before he could see its publication. Rivoira died in Rome at age 69. His manuscript was published posthumously. A Rivoira fellowship in medieval archaeology was established at the British School at Rome in his honor. Rivoira's method was to carefully measure monuents, compiling an immense amount a factual data about monuments to reach ""scientific conclusions."" Like his compatriot, Giacomo Boni, he used his engineering training to bring a new accuracy to archaeology. His long-term and ferocious debate with Strzygowski on the question of origins of the medieval styles came as a result of the newly staked out epistemological question. Both maintained that their method differed from traditional, subjective art history by what they considered scientific objectivity (Wharton). That their mutual belief in empirical archaeological evidence resulted in opposite conclusions stoked the debate more, both claiming to be free of bias. Both were susceptible to nationalistic sentiment, though Strzygowski's accusation that Rivoria's need to see Rome as the origin was because of Rivoira's nationalism, appeared more sustained. Rivoira was a patriot and made references to it in his writing. The extremes of the debate worsed with the world war into ""anti-Teutonic prejudices [which] caused Rivoira terrible anxieties,"" (Strong). His work was admired and used by Robert Charles de Lasteyrie du Saillant and W. R. Lethaby, among others. His belief of the supremacy of Lombardy in Romanesque and early Gothic architecture is today universally rejected (Ehresmann). His arguement, however, convinced A. Kingsley Porter at the time, who espoused it in his 1915 book Lombard Architecture.","[bibliography:] ""Bibliography of the Author."" Rivoira, Giovanni.

Romanini was born in Legnano and trained at the University of Pavia under Eduardo Yetwart Arslan (1899-1968). She then continued her studies at the Scuola di specializzazione di Roma under  Geza De Francovich and Guilo Carlo Argan where she focused on late medieval art and architecture. She wrote extensively on the humanistic culture of northern Italy including works on Donatello, Mategna, and Bramante. She contributed to important works on Lombard architecture throughout the 13th to 15th century and also Romanques art during the Veronese era. She argued that the formation of the Cistercians and their development of the fulcrum marked a transition between the Romanesque and Gothic in Lombardy. Her monograph on Arnolfo di Cambio marked a transition in the scholars focus from individual artists to scientific research. In 1972, she transferred to the University of Rome as the Chair of the Medieval Art History department. She organized Settimane di Storia dell’arte medievale, a weekly international conference that has been fundamental for international bibliography. Many of these conferences lead to publications.  She was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei beginning in 1987, the Pontificia Accademia di Archeologia e Storia dell’Arte, and the Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften of Vienna. The first of her twelve publications for the l'Enciclopedia dell'arte medievale was released in 1991. These monumental volumes, noted for their scholarly approach, were promoted by the Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana.

In addition to her work in academia, she promoted the discipline of art history through her organization of international conventions which lead to the formation of Storia dell’arte medioevale in Italia, a university textbook. Her commitment to the field of art history and work on the prestigious magazine Arte medievale contributed to a revival of medieval studies in Italy.

"Salerno, Luigi","Salerno, Luigi","Luigi Salerno","03 September 1924","22 July 1992","Rome, Italy","","Italy","male","","","Scholar of the Italian baroque and Salvator Rosa; historiographer. Luigi Salerno was born Aldo Salerno and Maria Santangelo. His maternal uncle was the art historian Antonino Santangelo. He graduated from Università di Roma, ""La Sapienza,"" in 1946 with a laurea in Storia dell'arte moderna, writing his thesis on the Macchiaioli under Lionello Venturi. He secured a scholarship from the Istituto d'archeologia e storia dell'arte in 1946 and during its final year, 1948, a fellowship at the Warburg Institute in London. At the Warburg he came in contact with the important, largely expatriate art historians who in many ways defined his methodology. These included Fritz Saxl and E. H. Gombrich, and most closely, Rudolf Wittkower. In London, too, Salerno encountered the art historian/collector, heir to the Guinness Mahon merchant banking fortune, Denis Mahon. The two became life-long friends with Mahon advising Salerno's early works particularly his books on Giovanni Lanfranco and Giulio Mancini. Mahon also introduced Salerno to Benedict Nicolson, the editor of the prestigeous The Burlington Magazine. Nicolson encouraged him to publish in the magazine, which became his entre into the English-language art world. Salerno shared a flate in Rome with Alessandro Marabottini, assistant to Mario Salmi. In 1953 Salerno married Elda Campana. Salerno joined the Antichità e belle arti del ministero della pubblica istruzione in 1947 and the following year to the Soprintendenza alle gallerie di Roma. After the catalog Il Seicento Europeo, 1956, written with Marabottini, he was promoted in 1958 to monuments director for Lazio (Soprintendenza ai monumenti del Lazio). There he researched and wrote on the urban history of Rome beginning with, Altari barocchi in 1959. The same year he was appointed professor in art history at the Università di Roma. He joined the editorial committee of the Enciclopedia universale dell'arte publishing the monumental article on art historiography in the 1963 volume. His articles in the Burlington Magazine on the inventory of the collection of Vincenzo Giustiani, 1960, established his scholarly reputation. Salerno followed this with important contributions to the Via del Corso edited by Carlo Pietrangeli, 1961. Other studies of the Roman architecture and urban space by Salerno included Palazzo Rondinini (1964), Piazza di Spagna (1967), and Roma communis patria (1968). Together with Luigi Spezzaferro and the architectural historian Manfredo Tafuri, the trio published Via Giulia: una utopia urbanistica del 500 in 1973. Salerno acted as visual arts co-director for the journal Palatino. In 1965 he taught as a visiting professor at Pennsylvania State University for the fall semester. An acquaintance with Robert Enggass and his wife, Catherine, resulted in their acting as translators of several of his works. In the 1960s, Salerno, again with Mahon, authenticated two Caravaggio paintings in American museums, ""Martha and Mary Magdalene"" (Detroit Institute of Arts) and ""The Crucifixion of Saint Andrew"" (Cleveland Museum of Art). Salerno won a 1968-1969 Fulbright scholarship as a fellow at the American Academy in Rome. He developed a particular interest in the relatively neglected painter Salvator Rosa, culmonating in a monograph on the painter in 1963. In 1967 Salerno was appointed director at the Calcografia nazionale and around this same time entrusted with the directorship of the Ufficio esportazione, known as the Dogana, the department authorizing exportation of works of art from Italy. In 1973 he left Rome for the Soprintendenza dell'Aquila but retired early from his administrative responsibilities to devote more of his time to research. Among publications during this time was a second book on Salvator Rosa in 1975 and the exhibition catalog for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1985, ""The Age of Caravaggio"" His I dipinti del Guercino, 1988.and I pittori di vedute in Italia, 1991, followed. He co-editor of the journal Storia dell'arte, founded by Giulio Carlo Argan in 1987. After a long illness, Salerno died in 1992, leavnig a photo archive of more than 3,500 photographs. His papers are held at the Getty Research Institute. Salerno's contributions to the history 17th and 18th century art in Italy was significant. His co-discovery of two Caravaggio paintings in the United States has not been questioned. His scholarship on Guercino remains important and he was an established authority on Luca Giordano and particularly Salvator Rosa. His specialty was in the so-called ""unacademic painters"" Filippo Napoletano, Jacques Callot, Angelo Caroselli, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Pier Francesco Mola, and Pietro Testa.","Lavagnino, Emilio, and Ansaldi, Guilio R.

Salmi received a law degree in 1910, but was won over to art history while attending the art history school of Adolfo Venturi at Rome University. The following year, 1911, Salmi published his first article in the journal L'Arte followed by numerous other pieces on Romanesque architecture and sculpture. Salmi was apppointed professor of medieval and modern art history at the university in Pisa, establishing the Instituto di Storia dell'Arte in 1927 and its study library (with Matteo Marangoni), Biblioteca del Gabinetto di Storia dell'Arte, in 1930. In 1929, Salmi moved to the University of Florence. There he founded the Instituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento in 1937. His students included Alessandro Marabottini. After World War II, Salmi established the art review journal Commentari in 1949. He was called to the University of Rome in 1950, which had been reorganized after World War II, assuming (Adolfo) Venturi's position as chair of the Renaissance and modern art history. Salmi brought the Commentari with him, co-edited now with Venturi's son, Lionello Venturi. He oversaw the creation of the multicultural 15-volume scholarly encyclopedia for art, Enciclopedia universale dell'arte, which appeared in 1958 and in English a year later as the Encyclopedia of World Art. As president of the Consiglio Superiore dele Antichità e Belle Arti until 1971, Salmi worked in the field of patronage and the evaluation of works of art. He wrote about many aspects of Florentine art, including manuscript illuminations, and a monograph on Piero della Francesca. Notes about Salmi's opinions on Giotto appear in Richard Offner's annotated catalog of the 1937 Mostra Giottesca. His papers and photographs collection are held at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA. In 1989 a conference sponsored by the Accademia Petrarca di Lettere, Arti e Scienze of Arezzo was held in commemoration of the centenary of Salmi's birth.

Salvini studied under Mario Salmi at the University of Florence in 1929. He continued study in the early 1930s in Berlin and Munich. In Berlin, his work under Albert Brinckmann gave him an appreciation for original texts and an analytical approach to source material. During this time he developed his theory of ""pure visibility"" in which he sought to give an abstract coherence to figurative values. His studies focused on the writings of the formalist art historians Bernard Berenson and Heinrich Wölfflin as well as the theories of the sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand. He joined the University of Florence where he taught for almost 30 years, over 20 of which being a museum administrator, rising to the directorship of the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, in 1950 (to 1956). Salvini's research area was Romanesque sculpture, building on the work of Pietro Toesca. He published his survey of Romanesque sculpture, La scultura romanica in Europa in 1956. He edited a methodological work, La critica d'arte moderna (la pura visibiltà), which analyzed the formalist from theorists such as Konrad Fiedler to art historians such as Adrian Stokes. His monograph on Wiligelmo appeared in 1956. In 1962 Salvini authored a volume on the capitals in the cloisters of the Duomo of Monreale, Il chiostro di Monreale e la scultura romanica in Sicilia, one in a series of volumes whose authors also included Ernst Kitzinger on the mosaics in the Cathedral and one on Norman architecture and the cathedral by Wolfgang Krönig.

"Tafuri, Manfredo","Tafuri, Manfredo","Manfredo Tafuri","04 November 1935","10 February 1994","Rome, Italy","Venice, Italy  ","Italy","male","","","Marxist architectural historian of the Renaissance and modern era; architectural theorist. Tafuri was born to Simmaco Tafuri and Elena Trevi (Tafuri). His father was an engineer. He studied architecture at the Scuola Superiore di Architettura at Rome (now within the University of Rome La Sapienza). As a student, he campaigned against such figures as Enrico del Debbio (1891-1973) and Saverio Muratori (1910-1973) advocating for curriculum change to include urban planning and architectural history. Tafuri attended courses by, among others, Giulio Carlo Argan, who was appointed chair of art history at Rome in 1959--the year of Tafuri's graduation--and the Marxist philosopher Galvano della Volpe (1895-1968). Tafuri supported the student actions that resulted in the reformist appointments of Luigi Piccinato (1899-1983), Ludovico Quaroni (1911-1987) and Bruno Zevi to the faculty in 1963 and 1964. He taught as an assistant to Quaroni, maintaining an architectural practice (in the Architetti e Urbanisti Associati) and supporting the 'counter-school' Associazione Studenti e Architetti. In the mid-1960s, Tafuri moved from practicing architecture to architectural history, initially teaching at the Politecnico di Milano as an assistant to Ernesto Nathan Rogers (1909-1969), 1964-1966, and in Palermo in 1966-1968 (where Cesare Brandi was also a professor). Tafuri wrote a small monograph on Quaroni and another on Japanese modernism in 1964. Early essays appeared in Quaderni dell'Istituto di storia dell'architettura, edited by Vicenzo Fasolo (1885-1969), Casabella-continua, Comunità of Adriano Olivetti (1901-1960), and the journal of Italia nostra. He married Guiseppina Rapisarda in 1966 and published his first major historical monograph, L'Architettura del manierismo nel '500 europeo, which secured him an appointment in Venice at the Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia in 1968. He remained at the Istituto his professional career. In 1968, too, he wrote the first of two books which would secure his reputation. Teorie e storia dell'architettura focused on the architectural historian's responsibility to change architecture fundamentally, chiding the deficiencies of architects as historians. It also predicted the failure of modernism (drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin, 1892-1940), citing modern architecture's complicity with capitalism. The book was criticized by Zevi and Paolo Portoghesi, both architect/historians, who disputed in particular the mission of architectural historians to shape contemporary architecture. After a monograph on Florentine culture, L'Architettura dell'Umanesimo, 1969, the second of his broad Marxist salvos, Progetto e Utopia, appeared in 1973, a historical assessment of architecture's relationship with capitalist development since the eighteenth century. Tafuri's innovative book subjects continued with La città americana and Via Giulia (a book of a Roman street) in 1973, the latter with Luigi Salerno and Luigi Spezzaferro, and regularly contributed to the American journal Oppositions as well as the European journals Casabella, Domus, and L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui. Though he ran for political office in Rome, his political associations remained informal, especially after the mid-1970s. Tafuri's interest increasingly moved to the French historiographical tradition (from the Annales School to the histories of technique of Michel Foucault, 1926-1984). In 1976, Tafuri transitioned the Istituto di Storia dell'Architettura at IUAV into a critical entity, the Dipartimento di Analisi, Critica e Storia dell'Architettura. Appointed Chair of the Istituto di storia dell'architettura at IUAV, Tafuri hired politically active architects, historians and philosophers whose research and writing projects were akin to Tafuri's. These included Cacciari, Giorgio Ciucci (b. 1939), Francesco Dal Co (b. 1945), Marco De Michelis (b. 1945) and Mario Manieri Elia (1929-2011). Together with Georges Teyssot (b. 1946) and Cacciari, Tafuri invited Foucault to Venice in 1978 for a series of discussions, published as Il dispositivo Foucault, 1978. He again reorganized the Istituto again in 1982 as the Dipartimento di Storia dell'Architettura, shifting emphasis from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the early modern period. His essays from the 1960s and 1970s were collected as La sfera e il labirinto in 1980. Tafuri's only volume in the the Microstoria series edited by Carlo Ginzburg and Giovanni Levi, on the Venetian church of San Francesco della Vigna, La chiesa di S. Francesco della vigna nella Venezia was co-authored by Antonio Foscari in 1983. Venezia e il rinascimento appeared in 1985 followed by a broad and polemical assessment of Italy's architectural history since the end of World War Two, Storia dell'architettura italiana, 1944-85, 1986, in which he castigated those architects who had ensured a the trajectory from post-war ineffectuality to postmodern frivolity, particularly Carlo Aymonino and Carlo Scarpa. The work came under criticism by Aldo Rossi. An essay on Peter Eisenman was published in Eisenman's book of essays, Houses of Cards, 1987. Tafuri's masterwork on this period, Ricerca del rinascimento (1992) revisited the Renaissance foundations of modern architecture, addressing architecture as an institution, tradition and technique. In his final years, Tafuri became a champion for architectural conservation carried out by trained architects. He succeeded in halting the plans for Renzo Piano to modernize the environs of Palladio's Basilica in Vincenza and was involved in the restoration of Giulio Romano's Palazzo Te. Tafuri was one of the first professional (academic) architectural historians in Italy. His opinions, always strongly argued, have been criticized for being uneven, perhaps a result of his constant revision of them. For example, he praised Le Corbusier's architecture in Algiers, but despaired Corbusier's Chandigarh work. He claimed regret in later years at the haste in which he wrote his first book, L'Architettura del manierismo nel '500 europeo. As the head of the so-called Venice School of architectural history, he exerted a substantial influence over generations of architects, historians and theorists in Italy, Europe and North America. Tafuri's Teorie e storia dell'architettura, stands as ""a pointed assessment of historical knowledge in architecture that positioned the architectural historian as an agent of institutional and political change"" (Leach). Progetto e Utopia, was a more pointed Marxist historical assessment of architecture's relationship with capitalist development since the eighteenth century. As a theorist, he saw capitalist production and consumption eroding values, not stabilizing them, and hence the modern era was not able to create a context of belief in which architecture could flower. Tafuri insisted there was no difference between criticism and history--that the tools and tasks (relative to contemporary architectural culture) remained constant as distance from the subject moved in time. As a Renaissance scholar, he was called to write essays on the retrospective exhibitions of Raphael (1984), Giulio Romano (1989) and Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1993). Tafuri accused his critics, Zevi and Portughese, as performing ""operative"" (or instrumental) architectural criticism, i.e., using their agendas as practicing architects to frame the history of architecture, anathema to his own ""critical"" position. He instead suggested that architectural criticism and history should be considered the same thing, and that practicing architects abandon criticism. The controversy distilled to the means by which architectural historians could positively affect the work of architects. Tafuri polemically held there should be no difference between criticism and history. Some of Tafuri's notions may have been drawn from the 1891 book, Architecture, Mysticism and Myth by W. R. Lethaby. In addition to influences by Foucault, Volpe, Benjamin, and Theodor Adorno (1903-1969), Tafuri's work shows the effect of the circles in which he operated in Venice and Rome, including the German-language scholarship of the Biblioteca Hertziana's Renaissance specialists.","Ludovico Quaroni e lo sviluppo dell'architettura moderna in Italia.

Tea was the daughter of a medical doctor and Anna Ricci, the director of the Asilo Umberto I in Vercelli. She was raised in Verona and graduated from University of Padua in 1911. She completed her graduate studies in art history in Rome in 1916 studying under Adolfo Venturi. Tea taught in Rome at a Liceo Classico and was an ispettrice di belle arti (Inspector of Fine Arts) in Ravenna as a Sovrintendenza ai Monumenti, and in Venice, Trento and Roman Forum. It was at the Roman Forum that she met Giacomo Boni. While he asked her to work as a secretary, they eventually conducted excavations together including that of the Basilica of Santa Maria Antiqua. She was then nominated to be a librarian in Milan at the Real Accademia di Belle Arti in Brera. In 1926, she enrolled in a free course at the Catholic University of Milan. She began working with Giuseppe Polvara (1884-1950) in 1929 to organize the Beato Angelico School. For many years, she worked with this avant-garde institution of artistic and political reform, however, when the school transformed into a religious institution subject to juridical conditions, she decided to focus on her students. The Scuola Beato Angelico eventually moved its headquarters to viale San Gimignano; she, however, remained at its old location and founded the Opera di assistenza agli artisti e alle modelle. Upon completion of the course at the Catholic University of Milan, she was first named to the department of Art Criticism and then to the department of Art History and Magisterium. Her most important contributions are found in the Arte Cristiana publications from 1927 to 1962. In 1964, she fractured her femur and her health slowly declined. She retired to live with her sister in 1967 and dying in 1971. She worked on the magazines Arte cristiana , Theatrica , and Vita e pensiero  and the newspapers Corriere della Sera  and Italia . Tea wrote the collection Quaderni dell’artista, and Umanesimo cristiano , Chiesa e impero nell’arte dei primi secoli Cristiani , Meditazioni su Giotto , and Paolo Veronese .

Methodologically, he distinguished himself for his anti-positivistic approach to art history, arguing that artistic value of any work is determined by the historical conditions under which it was produced (as opposed to the ""progress"" it represents from earlier pieces). Like many art historians, he was trained in philology, which he employed to great advantage in his analytical writings. Toesca's area was medieval art, which he lectured on until 1936, when he broadened his scope to Renaissance to Modern areas. His most famous student was the art historian Roberto Longhi, who wrote his disseration under Toesca. The prominent medievalist Ernst Kitzinger also studied under him in Rome. Toesca's work was praised by Josef Rudolf Thomas Strzygowski. His monograph on Giotto (1941) and his Trecento volume in the Storia dell'arte italiana remain major contributions to the history of art.

"Vasari, Giorgio","Vasari, Giorgio ","Giorgio Vasari","30 July 1511","27 June 1574","Arezzo, Italy","Florence, Italy","Italy","male","","","Considered the first art historian and often referred to as the ""father of art history""; architect and painter. Vasari was the son of Antonio Vasari (d. 1527), a potter [Vasari = ""maker of vases""], and Maddelena Tacci (d. 1558). His family stemmed from Cortona where his grandfather, Lazzaro, had been a craftsman of saddles and painted scenes. His great-aunt married the painter Lucca Signorelli, who became Vasari's first teacher. Vasari himself learned Latin and other humanist disciplines in the 1520's by Antonio da Saccone and Giovanni Pollastra (1465-1540). Throughout his career, Vasari practiced as an artist. He entered the Arezzo studio of Guillaume de Marcillat, a Frenchman commissioned to make the stained-glass windows for the cathedral in Arezzo. Guillaume's previous commissions at the Vatican in Rome brought Vasari into conversance with the work of Michelangelo and Raphael. Vasari's own skills as a painter led the Cardinal of Cortona, Silvio Passerini (1470-1529), tutor of Alessandro and Ippolito de' Medici, to take Vasari with him to Florence in 1524. There Vasari and the two Medici received further instruction by Pierio Valeriano (1477-1558). He lodged with Niccolo Vespucci beginning studies under Michelangelo, though this may have entailed little more than errands (Sonio). After Michelangelo left for Rome, Vasari trained in the Florentine workshop of Andrea del Sarto and in the sculpture workshop of Baccio Bandinelli, under Francesco Salviati. When the Medici were expelled in 1527, it was Vasari and Salviati who rescued the pieces of the broken ""David"" statue of Michelangelo for repair. Vasari returned to Arezzo where entered the service of Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici in January 1532. He studied ancient and modern Roman art and architecture again with Salviati and began collecting drawings which he assembled into a large folio for study purposes. When Alessandro de' Medici was murdered in 1537, Vasari was once again devoid of a princely patron. From that point on, he decided to exist on his own. He painted several work for the monks at Camaldoli before journeying to Rome in 1538, accompanied by his assistant Giovanni Battista Cungi. Already he was interested in studying ancient with a view of their effect on contemporary art, the core idea later into his masterwork of writing, the Vite. Vasari went to Venice in 1541. Back in Rome, Vasari purportedly got the idea to write a book on the lives of famous artists from the scholar and collector Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) during a dinner party given by Pope Paul III in 1546, although Vasari seems to have been collecting snippets from 1543. In 1548 he built a house in Arezzo (in which he seldom lived) marrying the well-connected Nicolosa Bacci the following year. Documents indicate he had two previous children either by Nicolosa's sister, Maddalena Bacci (d. 1542) or his housemaid, Isabella Mora (Cheney). He published the first edition of his account of artist's lives--most famous book--Le vite de più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori in 1550. The printer was the Florentine humanist Lorenzo Torrentino (d. 1563). The two-volume, octavo work was dedicated to Cosimo de' Medici. After its appearance several other biographies of artists appeared, most notably the life of Michelangelo by Ascanio Condivi. Vasari settled permanently in Florence in 1554. There he was commissioned to design the offices for the magistrates and civil records in 1560, the Uffizi (today the Uffizi Gallery). Vasari corrected and enlarged the text to the Vite, issuing a second edition in 1568. It is this version that all subsequent editions and translations are based, and for which Vasari owes his fame. For the second edition, Vasari incorporated information from the works of other writers who had taken his biography as a model, in particularly Lodovico Guicciardini (a Florentine living in Antwerp) and his Descrittione di m. Lodouico Guicciardini patritio fiorentino, di tutti i Paesi Bassi, 1567. A second book, somewhat of a supplement to the Lives, entitled Ragionamenti sopra le Invenzioni appeared from Vasari's hand after his death in 1588. The book is a catalog of the allegorical compositions in the Palazzo Vecchio. He continued as supervisor for the redesign and redecoration of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence until 1572. While engaged in the frescos for the dome of the Cathedral in Florence, he died. He is interred in the family tomb in Arezzo. At his death his drawing collection was dispersed, much of it still identifiable in major collections today. His Arezzo house is today a museum on the Via XX Settembre 55. Le vite de più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori - The work is divided into a preface (proemio), a discussion of the various media, and then three sections devoted to artist biographies arranged chronologically. The first section covers Cimabue to Lorenzo di Bicci, section two from Jacopo della Quercia to Pietro Perugino, and the final section, from Leonardo da Vinci to Michelangelo. Michelangelo was the only artist still living when the Vite appeared. Vasari ends with a section to 'artists and readers'. Several indexes complete the work. Chronological biographies of artists had previously existed. Vasari's contribution was to create a critical, i.e., evaluative, history of artistic style, although he was far from unbiased. Core to Vasari was the notion of the rebirth of art, a rinascita. Art had a history and by new birth, it reestablished itself as a noble pursuit worthy of study. Vasari's division of art history into ages took as its paradigm the stages of human development. This, too, was not a novel conception with Vasari, but in his book, it took on a logical sense of order. Art's early perfection was the antique, but hade then declined under Constantine. This low period of barbaric or Germanic art (""Gothic"" Vasari called it) far removed from classical models, was ready for renaissance. Cimabue, Giotto and others formed the nascence of art, inspired by the imitation of nature, a primary stage (primi lumi). A developmental period (augumento) was ultimately succeeded by the age of perfection (perfezione)--coincidentally Vasari's own time and that of Michelangelo. Vasari's book created a sensation. Benvenuto Cellini found much fault, but Michelangelo, Gherardi, Salviati and Carlo Fontana praised it.","Le vite de'più eccellenti pittori, scuttori e architetti. Florence: Lorenzo Torrentino, 1550.

Venturi was the son of Gaetano Venturi and Maria Barbieri (Venturi). He took courses at the academy and technical school in Modena, largely teaching himself classical history through access of the excellent library of G. B. Toesca. Acting as a private tutor, he saved enough money to attend the Institute of advanced studies in Florence. He studied the monuments in Florence and then Bologna, Venice, and ultimately Milan. In 1878 he was appointed curator at the Galleria Estense in Modena. Venturi used his position to scour the Emilian archives, grounding himself in what was now his career of art history. In 1888 he was appointed general inspector of the Belle Arti at the Ministry of Public Instruction in Rome. There he revitalized the rather traditional institution. He instituted the first formal training on treatment of works of art as well as the outline for the development of a catalog of the national artistic heritage. In 1896 requested a faculty appointment as chair in Medieval and Modern Art at the University of Rome where he instituted courses on modern art. As professor of art, he was particularly influenced by Benedetto Croce's aesthetics, especially Croce's the emphasis the individual in history. In the United States, Venturi weighed in on a celebrated authenticity debate of a version of a purported Leonardo painting, La Bella Ferroniere, owned by a Kansas City couple. Venturi' defended the opinion of Sir Josef Duveen, then being sued by the Mrs. Hahn, that the painting was a low copy. The incident provoked Hahn's husband into writing The Rape of La Belle (1946). Venturi remained at the University until his retirement in 1931. With Count Dominico Gnoli (1838-1915), Ventrui founded the journal, Archivio storico d'arte (after 1901, L'Arte) in 1888, editing it until 1940. He succeeded Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) as a member of the Paris Institute in 1901. His son, Lionello Venturi was also an art historian. His students included the Venetianist Giuseppe Fiocco. His unfinished twenty-five volume Storia dell'arte italiana (History of Italian Art), spanning early Christian art to the 16th century established a truly Italian art history, freeing it from dependence on foreign scholars. Methodologically, Venturi employed a conoisseurship-style to his art history. In the depression era of the United States in the 1930, his monograph was selected for translation by workers of the Works Project Administration (never published) in 1939.","La Madonna: Svolgimenyo artistico delle rappresentazzioni dell Vergine.

While Volpi was born in Macerata to Dante and Matilde Andreani and spent almost her entire life living in Rome. She attended the Guilio Cesare high school in Rome while taking courses at the Accademia d’Arte drammatica Silvio d’Amico (Silvio d’Amico Academy of Dramatic Arts) where she became interested in the Italian Communist Party. In 1952, she graduated from the Università “La Sapienza” di Roma writing her M.A. in Philosophy entitled Il pensiero politico di Pellegrino Rossi (The political thought of Pellegrino Rossi). Following her graduation, she began working with Roberto Longhi specializing in the art of the Florentine region. In Florence, she befriended the art critic Carla Lonzi (1931-1982). Working with Longhi on Medieval and Modern Art History, she defended her thesis, Il percorso di Corrado Giaquinto in 1956. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, Volpi taught art history and applied arts at the Istituto Statale d’Arte per l’Arredo and the Decorazione della Chiesa. She developed close relationships with Maria Teresa Benedetti (1929-), an art historian, and Giuseppe Uncini (1929-2008), an Italian sculptor. In 1966, she was awarded a Fulbright scholarship and travelled to the United States with her husband Ferdinando Orlandini (1926-1988). Throughout this trip, she met and collaborated with important art historians, critics and artists like De Kooning, Rothko and Rasuchenberg. She published important work including a book on Kandinsky in 1968 and Arte dopo il 1945 in 1969 following her return. Between 1969 and 1972, Volpi taught medieval, modern, and contemporary art at the University of Cagliari where she was colleagues with Corrado Maltese (1921-2001) and Italian art critic Gillo Dorfles (1910-2018). Her courses covered topics from Roman Classicism to American avant-garde and post-war art. Volpi then moved to Rome to teach Sociology of Art at the institute now called Università di Roma Tre until she earned a title as a professor. She was appointed to the chair of Contemporary Art at La Sapienza (Sapienza University of Rome) in 1982. Throughout the 1980s, she published several works on 19th century symbolist artists including Böcklin and De Chirico and works on Manet, Monet, Degas, and Morisot. Towards the end of her career she began writing fiction and short stories influenced by the biographical events and works of Romantic, Symbolist, and Impressionist artists. She was awarded the Premio Viareggio in 1986 and the Premio Vallombrosa in 1988. In 1993, she published an autobiographical novel entitled La casa di via Tolmino. Volpi taught at La Sapienza until 2003 with colleagues including Angiola Maria Romanini (1926-2002) and Maurizio Calvesi (1927-2020). In 2004, she was appointed Emeritus Professor of Contemporary Art History. She died in Rome on May 13, 2015. From her fictional works to her formal art historical publications, Volpi demonstrated her ability to use different temporal views to construct a fluid narrative for her readers (Sbrilli).

Zanetti began as a draftsman and artist, collaborating with his cousin, also called Anton Maria Zanetti, in illustrations for books. In 1733 he adapted Marco Boschini pictorial analysis of Venitian painting, Le ricche minere della pittura veneziana, (1674) into a new critical work, his Descrizione di tutte le pubbliche pitture della città di Venezia e isole circonvicine. Emboldened by the success of this early work, he set about writing a large-scale account of the Venetian school, Della pittura veneziana e delle opere pubbliche de' veneziani maestri (1771). Zanetti conceived of art history through an Enlightenment attitude. Descrizione begins with the ""Primitives"" of Italian art, moving quickly to the Renaissance artists of Venice. He disparaged Mannerism, contrasting it to Venetian painting, and characterizing the former as leading him to the excesses of the baroque. Zanetti was much admired by later art historians, particularly Luigi Antonio Lanzi who characterized Zanetti's text balanced and his historiography sound. For most of his life, from 1737 onward, he was librarian of the Biblioteca Marciana, the library of S Marco in Venice.","Della pittura Veneziana e delle opere pubbliche de' Veneziani Maestri libri V.

"Zeri, Federico","Zeri, Federico","","1921","04 October 1998","Rome, Italy","Mentana, Italy","Italy","male","","","Collector and art historian of renaissance Italy. Zeri was born into a wealthy Roman family. He attended Rome University, where he initially studied botany. In 1944 he switched to the department of fine art under Pietro Toesca, a leading scholar of (then) undervalued Italian medieval art. Toesca introduced him to Roberto Longhi. He also made the personal acquaintance of influential rival to Longhi, Harvard art historian Bernard Berenson. Zeri described his meeting with Berenson as lasting ""from 16:32 to 16:54 precisely"". After graduating, Zeri worked for the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage in its fine arts committee for six years. In 1952, however, Zeri left, claiming that mismanagement and bureaucratic lethargy in the ministry were destroying the very monuments they were intended to save. Others suggested that Giulio Carlo Argan, the Inspector, actually dismissed Zeri for reasons of conflict of interest with private work. This proved to be a boon for Zeri, who developed his profile as an art historian by writing and lecturing. He published catalogs from two famous private collections in Rome, the Galleria Spada (1954) and the Galleria Pallavicini (1959). He advised collectors such as the Venetian Count Vittorio Cini. He was a visiting professor in the United States at Harvard and Columbia. In 1957, still only 36, he published Pittura e Controriforma, a book on Mannerism praised by Donald Posner) and was commissioned to catalog of the Italian paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Florentine School, 1971; The Venetian School, 1973; and The Siennese School, 1980). At roughly the same time, he also collaborated with Burton Fredericksen on the Inventories of Italian paintings in the United States. In 1976 he published a similar catalog of Italian painting in Baltimore's Walter Art Gallery. These are considered among his best scholarhsip. In the 1980s Zeri took over co-editorship of the 13-volume Storia dell'arte italiana, the scholarly survey of Italian art. In later years, he focused his writing on forgery and issues of methodology. L'Inchiostro Variopinto (1985) recounts his unmasking of fakes. Dietro L'Immagine: conversazioni sull'arte di leggere l'arte (1987, translated into English as Behind the Image, 1990) focused on methodology. Zeri was appointed a founding member of the Board of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. In 1993, when he could not dissuade the museum from purchasing a Greek kouros, which he insisted was a forgery, he resigned in protest. The incident was widely reported and today the museum lists the piece as ""circa 530 B.C. or modern forgery."" In 1994 he published Giorno per Giorno nella Pittura a book highlighting lesser-known works in Italy that Zeri championed. Although he chided his country as unfit to be a custodian of its own treasures, he supervised the restoration of the Royal Palace and the Sforza Castle in Milan shortly before his death. Zeri was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Bologna, nearly the only honor he received within Italy. He subsequently left his villa/museum/library to the University. Zeri's methodology reflects the connoisseurship approach of Berenson and Longhi, though he disparaged both men in later years. When writing in his area of expertise, Italian painting from the 12th to the 16th centuries, or even as far afield as Modigliani, Zeri was capable of greatness. He shunned the traditional monograph format, focusing instead on erudite, well- researched yet readable shorter articles and scholarly museum catalogs. Yet Zeri personified the eccentric art historian: he toured visitors through his 1960s villa, filled with important works of art next to kitchy objet d'art, subjecting guests to his unique interpretations. Michelangelo, he once said, was such a poor painter that it would not have been a great loss if his Sistine Chapel paintings had been allowed to crumble. He characterized Ludovisi Throne (now in the Palazzo Altemps) as a 19th-century fake rather than the fifth century BC Greek sculpture generally believed today to be. He and the conservator Bruno Zanardi, denied Giotto's hand in the Basilica of St. Francis at Assisi frescos. At the root of many of his excellent re-attributions was his scorn for the Italian academy which he chided in almost every submission of his newspaper and radio program. To the notion that Florence was the birthplace of the renaissance innovation, Zeri characterized as a ""sad episode of cultural hooliganism."" Although he had criticized Longhi's authenticating questionable works of art for monetary gain, similar accusations were also made against him.","and Gardner, Elizabeth E.
