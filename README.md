# Geohistorians

Geohistorians propose an analysis of art historians and the keepers that preserve their collections. Our data sample is composed of the __Italian art historians__ recorded in __Dictionary of Art Historians and ArtChives__.
The Dictionary of Art Historians is a free, privately funded biographical dictionary of historians of western art written and maintained by scholars, while ArtChives collects detailed archival descriptions of notable art historians' collections.
Finally, we integrated the extracted information through __Wikidata__, one of the most famous collaborative and open source databases. The project workflow was articulated in four different phases: the data cleaning and access, for which some data have been integrated automatically and manually, enriching the original database; the data analysis, where some patterns were found and exposed in the data visualization process, finally integrated and commented in the storytelling and web development phase.
You can find the complete cleaning and analysis phases on our [__Jupyter Notebook__](00_DoAH_first_cleaning.ipynb).

The project was realized for the course in Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling taught by Prof. Marilena Daquino at the University of Bologna for the year 2021-2022.
